<tr><th>Color</th><td><span title="null">Good on most newer models</span></td><td><span title="null">Excellent</span></td><td><span title="null">Vivid and wide gamut,
blue OLED degrades faster than other colors so manufacturers may overdrive the blue LEDs to compensate, causing oversaturated colors 
organic materials decay over time (2011)</span></td><td><span title="null">Excellent</span></td></tr>
<tr><th>Black level</th><td><span title="null">Poor due to bleed through</span></td><td><span title="null">Excellent</span></td><td><span title="null">Excellent</span></td><td><span title="null">Excellent</span></td></tr>
<tr><th>Flicker and eyestrain</th><td><span title="null">Depends; as of 2013, most LCDs use PWM (strobing) to dim the backlight which can cause severe eyestrain for some people although the flicker isn't visible because it is normally done at 200 Hz or faster</span></td><td><span title="null">Poor due to phosphor based but improving in newer models</span></td><td><span title="null">Part of the screen always lit during refreshes due to multiplexing</span></td><td><span title="null">Part of the screen always lit during refreshes;
flicker noticeable at refresh rates below 85 Hz</span></td></tr>
<tr><th>Brightness</th><td><span title="null">Very poor in direct sunlight without reflective design (battery powered devices);
uneven backlighting in older models;
low temperatures can cause dimming or blackout</span></td><td><span title="null">Some panels are highly reflective, should be used in a dark environment for optimum picture quality</span></td><td><span title="null">Poor in bright ambient light;
white color dimmer than LCDs of same brightness</span></td><td><span title="null">Some compensate for ambient light</span></td></tr>

<tr><th>Ghosting and smearing</th><td><span title="null">Display motion blur on models with slow response time, and the elimination technique (strobing backlight) can cause eye-strain</span></td><td><span title="null">None even during fast motion, advancements in 3D have eliminated phosphor trailing due to the use of fast-switching phosphors</span></td><td><span title="null">None even during fast motion</span></td><td><span title="null">No ghosting or smearing artifacts;
slightly blurry;
halo may appear around objects with high contrast to background</span></td></tr>

<tr><th>Frame rate</th><td><span title="null">60 or 75 fps typically;
internally, display usually refreshed at 200 Hz</span></td><td><span title="null">60 fps typically, some can do 120 fps;
internally, display refreshed at eg. 480 or 600 Hz</span></td><td><span title="null"></span></td><td><span title="null">60–85 fps typically, some CRTs can go even higher ("200 fps at reduced resolution");
internally, display refreshed at input frame rate speed</span></td></tr>
<tr><th>Other</th><td><span title="null">The LCD grid can mask effects of spatial and grayscale quantization, creating the illusion of higher image quality. 
Many newer models are powered by an external 12V power supply (for thinness), and could (with a special cable) be connected directly to the computer's power supply, possibly saving power, desk space and wall-outlet space</span></td><td><span title="null">Screen-door effects are more noticeable than LCD when up close, or on larger sizes;
fragile and required to be upright to avoid screen collapse</span></td><td><span title="null">No backlight needed, 
can be fabricated on flexible plastic substrates for flexible displays</span></td><td><span title="null">No native resolution. Currently, the only display technology capable of multi-syncing (displaying different resolutions and refresh rates without the need for scaling). Display lag is extremely low due to its nature, which does not have the ability to store image data before output, unlike LCDs, plasma displays and OLED displays.</span></td></tr>
<tr><th>Size</th><td><span title="null">Compact, 
can be manufactured almost any size and shape, 
very thin allowing mounted distance to user for less focusing-related eyestrain</span></td><td><span title="null">Up to 150"(3.8m)</span></td><td><span title="null">Compact, can be made in nearly any size or shape.</span></td><td><span title="null">Bulky depth, 
7" smallest possible for color screen, 
over 40" is very heavy</span></td></tr>
<tr><th>Environmental influences</th><td><span title="null">Low temperatures can cause slow response, high temperatures can cause poor contrast</span></td><td><span title="null">High altitude pressure difference may cause poor function or buzzing noises</span></td><td><span title="null">UV exposure can damage,

earth's magnetic fields may cause distortion</span></td></tr>
<tr><th>Energy consumption and heat generation</th><td><span title="null">Low
