For any conversions or rollovers in 2010, any amounts that are required to be included in income are included in income in equal amounts in 2011 and 2012. If you elect otherwise, you can choose to include the entire amount in income in 2010. per IRS Pub. 590, Pg. 63.Beginning in 2013 you can roll your Traditional 401(k) into a Roth 401(k) if your company offers a roth option","generated_KMF_ID":"5665982451419269510363","feature":["features[13524548431419269510359]"],"interpretation":[]}
