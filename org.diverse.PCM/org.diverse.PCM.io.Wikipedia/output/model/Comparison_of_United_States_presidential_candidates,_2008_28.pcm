He proposes $150 billion over 10 years to accelerate the commercialization of plug-in hybrid, promote development of commercial scale renewable energy (establishing a 100% federal RPS to require that 10 percent of electricity be derived from renewable sources by 2012 and 25% in 2025), encourage energy efficiency, advance the next generation of biofuel (requiring 60 billion US gallons (230,000,000 m) by 2030) and fuel infrastructure, and begin transition to a new digital electricity grid (smart metering, demand response, distributed generation and electricity storage systems). He also plans to reduce overall U.S. oil consumption by at least 35%, or 10 million barrels (1,600,000 m) per day, by 2030 to offset imports from OPEC nations. Obama and other Senators introduced the BioFuels Security Act in 2006.  Regarding the domestic use of nuclear power, Obama declared himself flatly opposed to building a nuclear waste repository in Nevada and has called for the facility's closure. However, Obama voted for the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which allocated $4.3 billion in tax credits to the nuclear energy sector. Obama and other Senators introduced a bill in 2007 to promote the development of commercially viable plug-in hybrids and other electric-drive vehicles in order to shift away from petroleum fuels and \"toward much cleaner – and cheaper – electricity for transportation\". In his plan, related with transportation, he proposes  increase fuel economy standard 4 percent per each year, specific focus on R&D in advanced battery technology and a $7,000 tax credit for the purchase of advanced technology vehicles as well as conversion tax credits and $4 billion retooling tax credits and loan guarantees for domestic auto plants and parts manufacturers; the entire White House fleet would be converted to plug-ins and half of cars purchased by the federal government will be plug-in (hybrids or all-electric) vehicles by 2012.","generated_KMF_ID":"8704332591426087264504","feature":["features[19008857181426087264504]"],"interpretation":[]}
