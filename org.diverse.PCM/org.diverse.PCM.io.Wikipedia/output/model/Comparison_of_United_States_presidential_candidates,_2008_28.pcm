He says \"technologies are way ahead of the political framework\" and envisions a \"massive conversion from a hydrocarbon-based economy to a carbohydrate-based economy\" within 20 to 25 years. He opposes corn ethanol \"which has a very poor net energy and water-usage characteristic\" in favor of cellulosic ethanol. He says that cap-and-trade programs \"can be easily manipulated\"  and wants to tax inefficient technology and pollution at the production source.","generated_KMF_ID":"17249166981419264239106","feature":["features[1155137451419264239106]"],"interpretation":[]}

Obama and other Senators introduced the BioFuels Security Act in 2006.  Regarding the domestic use of nuclear power, Obama declared himself flatly opposed to building a nuclear waste repository in Nevada and has called for the facility's closure. However, Obama voted for the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which allocated $4.3 billion in tax credits to the nuclear energy sector. Obama and other Senators introduced a bill in 2007 to promote the development of commercially viable plug-in hybrids and other electric-drive vehicles in order to shift away from petroleum fuels and \"toward much cleaner – and cheaper – electricity for transportation\". In his plan, related with transportation, he proposes  increase fuel economy standard 4 percent per each year, specific focus on R&D in advanced battery technology and a $7,000 tax credit for the purchase of advanced technology vehicles as well as conversion tax credits and $4 billion retooling tax credits and loan guarantees for domestic auto plants and parts manufacturers; the entire White House fleet would be converted to plug-ins and half of cars purchased by the federal government will be plug-in (hybrids or all-electric) vehicles by 2012.","generated_KMF_ID":"11111804711419264239106","feature":["features[1155137451419264239106]"],"interpretation":[]}
