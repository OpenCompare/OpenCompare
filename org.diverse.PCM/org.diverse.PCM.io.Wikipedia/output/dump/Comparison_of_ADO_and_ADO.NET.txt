business model
connection-oriented models used mostly
disconnected models are used:message-like models.
disconnected access
provided by record set
provided by data adapter and data set
xml support
limited
robust support
connection model
client application needs to be connected always to data-server while working on the data, unless using client-side cursors or a disconnected record set
client disconnected as soon as the data is processed. dataset is disconnected at all times.
data passing
ado objects communicate in binary mode.
ado.net uses xml for passing the data.
control of data access behaviors
includes implicit behaviors that may not always be required in an application and that may therefore limit performance.
provides well-defined, factored components with predictable behavior, performance, and semantics.
design-time support
derives information about data implicitly at run time, based on metadata that is often expensive to obtain.
leverages known metadata at design time in order to provide better run-time performance and more consistent run-time behavior.
