goals
designed to offer very high image quality with excellent compression efficiency
designed to meet a variety of industry needs with many profiles and levels, allowing for varying compression, quality and cpu usage levels, where the lowest level is for portable devices, designed with low cpu usage in mind, while the high levels are designed with very high quality and compression efficiency in mind
example industry use
supports 4:2:0 compression / color space
supports studio archiving requirements with 4:4:4 color space; separate black and white (bw) video mode
