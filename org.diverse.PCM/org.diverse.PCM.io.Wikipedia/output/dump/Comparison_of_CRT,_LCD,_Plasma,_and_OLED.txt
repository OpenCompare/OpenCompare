parameter
crt
lcd
plasma
oled
brightness
some compensate for ambient light
very poor in direct sunlight without reflective design (battery powered devices); uneven backlighting in older models; low temperatures can cause dimming or blackout
some panels are highly reflective, should be used in a dark environment for optimum picture quality
poor in bright ambient light; white color dimmer than lcds of same brightness
contrast
over 15,000:1
over 1,000:1
over 20,000:1
over 1,000,000:1
color
excellent
good on most newer models
excellent
vivid and wide gamut, blue oled degrades faster than other colors so manufacturers may overdrive the blue leds to compensate, causing oversaturated colors organic materials decay over time (2011)
color depth
unlimited
up to 68 × 10
68 × 10

black level
excellent
poor due to bleed through
excellent
excellent
ghosting and smearing
no ghosting or smearing artifacts; slightly blurry; halo may appear around objects with high contrast to background
display motion blur on models with slow response time, and the elimination technique (strobing backlight) can cause eye-strain
none even during fast motion, advancements in 3d have eliminated phosphor trailing due to the use of fast-switching phosphors
none even during fast motion
response time
sub-milisecond
1–8 ms typical (according to manufacturer data), older units could be as slow as 35 ms
sub-millisecond
sub-millisecond
frame rate
60–85 fps typically, some crts can go even higher ("200 fps at reduced resolution"); internally, display refreshed at input frame rate speed
60 or 75 fps typically; internally, display usually refreshed at 200 hz
60 fps typically, some can do 120 fps; internally, display refreshed at eg. 480 or 600 hz

environmental influences
magnetic fields may cause distortion or shimmer, earth's magnetic fields may cause distortion
low temperatures can cause slow response, high temperatures can cause poor contrast
high altitude pressure difference may cause poor function or buzzing noises
uv exposure can damage, water can damage organic materials
flicker and eyestrain
part of the screen always lit during refreshes; flicker noticeable at refresh rates below 85 hz
depends; as of 2013, most lcds use pwm (strobing) to dim the backlight which can cause severe eyestrain for some people although the flicker isn't visible because it is normally done at 200 hz or faster
poor due to phosphor based but improving in newer models
part of the screen always lit during refreshes due to multiplexing
aging
yes
yes
yes
yes, different colors age at very different rates
weight
heavy, especially for larger units, a 20 inches (51 cm) screen weighs about 50 pounds (23 kg)
light
heavy, however, less weight gain per size increase
very light
size
bulky depth, 7" smallest possible for color screen, over 40" is very heavy
compact, can be manufactured almost any size and shape, very thin allowing mounted distance to user for less focusing-related eyestrain
up to 150"(3.8m)
compact, can be made in nearly any size or shape.
energy consumption and heat generation
high
low with ccfl backlight 30–50% of crt, with led backlight 10–25% of crt
varies with brightness but usually higher than lcd
varies with brightness but usually lower than lcd (except when displaying a lot of white area)
screen burn-in
yes, the reason screensavers became popular
discoloring may occur due to thermalization, but usually it is not permanent; dead or stuck pixels may occur in manufacturing or usage
severe in early models, dead or stuck pixels may occur in manufacturing or usage
yes, dead or stuck pixels may occur in manufacturing or usage
maintenance
hazardous to repair or service due to high-voltage, requires skilled convergence calibration and adjustments for geographic location changes
difficult to replace backlight


is compatible with light pen or guns
yes
no
no
no
electro-magnetic radiation emission
emits strong electromagnetic radiation in the audio-frequency to low-frequency rf range (from the electron beam deflection coils)
emits very little electromagnetic radiation
emits strong radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation
emits very little electromagnetic radiation
other
no native resolution. currently, the only display technology capable of multi-syncing (displaying different resolutions and refresh rates without the need for scaling). display lag is extremely low due to its nature, which does not have the ability to store image data before output, unlike lcds, plasma displays and oled displays.
the lcd grid can mask effects of spatial and grayscale quantization, creating the illusion of higher image quality. many newer models are powered by an external 12v power supply (for thinness), and could (with a special cable) be connected directly to the computer's power supply, possibly saving power, desk space and wall-outlet space
screen-door effects are more noticeable than lcd when up close, or on larger sizes; fragile and required to be upright to avoid screen collapse
no backlight needed, can be fabricated on flexible plastic substrates for flexible displays
