truncate

truncate.gbudb.net
extremely conservative list of single ip4 addresses that produce exclusively spam/malware as indicated by the gbudb ip reputation system. most systems should be able to safely reject connections based on this list.
automatic: ips are added when the gbudb "cloud" statistics reach a probability figure that indicates 95% of messages produce a spam/malware pattern match and a confidence figure that indicates sufficient data to trust the probability data.
automatic: continuous while reputation statistics remain bad. warning: produces false positives, and has no remedy/removal process. ips are dropped quickly if the statistics improve (within an hour). ips are dropped within 36 hours (typ) if no more messages are seen (dead zombie).
source data is derived from a global network of message sniffer filtering nodes in real-time. truncate data is updated from statistics every 10 minutes.
