! Automata-based programming
| 
| Treats programs as a model of a finite state machine or any other formal automata
| AsmL
| State enumeration, control variable, state changes, isomorphism, state transition table
| Imperative, event-driven
|-
! Declarative
| 
| Defines computation logic without defining its detailed control flow
| SQL, regular expressions, CSS, Prolog
| 4GL, spreadsheet, report program generator
| 
|-
! Event-driven including time driven
| 
| Program flow is determined mainly by events, such as mouse click or interrupts including timer
| ActionScript
| Main loop, event handlers, asynchronous processes
| Procedural, dataflow
|-
! Functional
| 
| Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions avoiding state and mutable data
| Erlang, Haskell, Lisp, Clojure, Scala, SML, F#, SequenceL, Python
| Lambda calculus, compositionality, formula, recursion, referential transparency, no side effects
| Declarative
|-
! Imperative
| Edsger W. Dijkstra, Michael A. Jackson
| Computation as statements that directly change a program state (datafields)
| C, C++, Java, PHP, Python
| Direct assignments, common data structure, global variable
| 
|-
! Object-oriented
| See here and
| Treats datafields as objects manipulated through pre-defined methods only
| Common Lisp, C++, C#, Eiffel, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala
| Objects, methods, message passing, information hiding, data abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, serialization-marshalling

! Paradigm
| Critics?
| Description
| Examples
| Main characteristics
| Related paradigm(s)
|-
! Procedural
| 
| Derived from structured programming, based on the concept of modular programming or the procedure call
| C, C++, Lisp, PHP, Python
| Local variable, sequence, selection, iteration, and modularization
| Structured, imperative
|-
! Structured
| 
| A style of imperative programming with more logical program structure
| C, C++, Java, Python
| Structogram, indentation, either no, or limited use of, goto statements
| Imperative
