! Amount of nuclear fuel in reactors
| 1 reactor - 245 tons
| 4 reactors - 1852 tons (274 tons in reactors + 409 tons in reactor storage pools and 1169 tons in central pool)
|-
! Area affected
| An area up to 500 kilometres (310 mi) away contaminated, according to the United Nations .
| Radiation levels exceeding annual limits seen over 60 kilometres (37 mi) to northwest and 40 kilometres (25 mi) to south-southwest, according to officials. Plus Pacific Ocean (accurate data not available)
|-
! Cause of the accident
| Faulty design leading to instability at low power (positive void coefficient), along with poor safety culture, leading to prompt critical and steam explosion during an improvised experiment.
| Faulty design concerning the likelihood of tsunamis in that area. Loss of cooling system due to earthquake and tsunami destroying power lines and backup generators, leading to  meltdown. Failure to plan for total loss of off-site power and back-up power.
|-
! Current status
| All reactors were shut down by 2000. The damaged reactor is covered by a hastily built steel and concrete structure called the sarcophagus. A New Safe Confinement structure is under construction and expected to be completed in 2015, from which the plant will be cleaned up and decommissioned.
| Cold shutdown declared on 16 December 2011, but decommissioning is likely to take 30 to 40 years. 85% of fuel rods in reactor 4 pool removed; completion expected by 31 December 2014.
|-
! Date of the accident
| April 26, 1986
| March 11, 2011
|-
! Direct fatalities from the accident
| 31; 64 confirmed deaths from radiation as of 2008
| 2 crew members (gone to inspect the buildings immediately after the earthquake and before the tsunami) due to drowning
|-
! Electrical output
| plant: 4 gigawatts; 925 MWe rated power per reactor
| plant: 4.7 gigawatt; reactor 1 is rated 439 MWe, reactors 2-3 are 784 MWe each, and reactor 4 was in cold shutdown

|-
! Location
| Soviet Union (Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic)
| Japan
|-
! Maximum level of radiation detected
| 300 Sv/h shortly after explosion in vicinity of the reactor core
| 72.9 Sv/h (Inside Reactor 2)
|-
! Number of reactors
| 4; 1 involved in accident
| 6; 4 (and spent-fuel pools) involved in accident
|-
! Plant commissioning date
| 1977
| 1971
|-
! Population relocated
| About 115,000 from areas surrounding the reactor in 1986; about 220,000 people from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine after 1986 (335,000 people total)
| 300,000
|-
! Radiation released
| 5.2 EBq (5,200 PBq)
| 900 PBq "into the atmosphere in March last year [2011] alone" up from previous estimates of 370 PBq total. As of 2014, a peer reviewed estimate of the total was 340 to 800 PBq, with 80% falling into the Pacific ocean. Radiation continues to be released into the Pacific via groundwater, as of 15 September 2013.
|-
! Type of reactor
| RBMK-1000 graphite moderated, 2nd generation reactor without containment
| Boiling water reactor with containment vessel. Reactor 1 is a BWR-3; the rest are BWR-4.
|-
! Years of operation before the accident
| 9 years
| 40 years
