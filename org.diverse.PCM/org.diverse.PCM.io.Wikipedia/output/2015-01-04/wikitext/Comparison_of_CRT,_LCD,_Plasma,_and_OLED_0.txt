! Aging
| yes
| yes
| yes, different colors age at very different rates
| yes
|-
! Black level
| Excellent
| Poor due to bleed through
| Excellent
| Excellent
|-
! Brightness
| Some compensate for ambient light
| Very poor in direct sunlight without reflective design (battery powered devices);
uneven backlighting in older models;
low temperatures can cause dimming or blackout
| Poor in bright ambient light;
white color dimmer than LCDs of same brightness
| Some panels are highly reflective, should be used in a dark environment for optimum picture quality
|-
! Color
| Excellent
| Good on most newer models
| Vivid and wide gamut,
blue OLED degrades faster than other colors so manufacturers may overdrive the blue LEDs to compensate, causing oversaturated colors 
organic materials decay over time (2011)
| Excellent
|-
! Color depth
| Unlimited
| Up to 68 × 10

| 68 × 10
|-
! Contrast
| Over 15,000:1
| Over 1,000:1
| Over 1,000,000:1
| Over 20,000:1
|-
! Electro-magnetic radiation emission
| Emits strong electromagnetic radiation in the audio-frequency to low-frequency RF range (from the electron beam deflection coils)
| Emits very little electromagnetic radiation
| Emits very little electromagnetic radiation
| Emits strong radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation
|-
! Energy consumption and heat generation
| High
| Low
with CCFL backlight 30–50% of CRT, with LED backlight 10–25% of CRT
| Varies with brightness but usually lower than LCD (except when displaying a lot of white area)
| Varies with brightness but usually higher than LCD
|-
! Environmental influences
| Magnetic fields may cause distortion or shimmer,
earth's magnetic fields may cause distortion
| Low temperatures can cause slow response, high temperatures can cause poor contrast
| UV exposure can damage,
water can damage organic materials
| High altitude pressure difference may cause poor function or buzzing noises
|-
! Flicker and eyestrain
| Part of the screen always lit during refreshes;
flicker noticeable at refresh rates below 85 Hz
| Depends; as of 2013, most LCDs use PWM (strobing) to dim the backlight which can cause severe eyestrain for some people although the flicker isn't visible because it is normally done at 200 Hz or faster
| Part of the screen always lit during refreshes due to multiplexing
| Poor due to phosphor based but improving in newer models
|-
! Frame rate
| 60–85 fps typically, some CRTs can go even higher ("200 fps at reduced resolution");
internally, display refreshed at input frame rate speed
| 60 or 75 fps typically;
internally, display usually refreshed at 200 Hz
| 
| 60 fps typically, some can do 120 fps;
internally, display refreshed at eg. 480 or 600 Hz
|-
! Ghosting and smearing
| No ghosting, smearing possible with moving bright objects on dark backgrounds after wear;
slightly blurry;
bloom may appear around objects with high contrast to background
| Display motion blur on models with slow response time, and the elimination technique (strobing backlight) can cause eye-strain
| None even during fast motion
| None even during fast motion, advancements in 3D have eliminated phosphor trailing due to the use of fast-switching phosphors
|-
! Is compatible with Light pen or guns
| Yes
| No
| No
| No
|-
! Maintenance
| Hazardous to repair or service due to high-voltage, 
requires skilled convergence calibration and adjustments for geographic location changes
| Difficult to replace backlight
| 
| 
|-
! Other
| No native resolution. Currently, the only display technology capable of multi-syncing (displaying different resolutions and refresh rates without the need for scaling). Display lag is extremely low due to its nature, which does not have the ability to store image data before output, unlike LCDs, plasma displays and OLED displays.
| The LCD grid can mask effects of spatial and grayscale quantization, creating the illusion of higher image quality. 
Many newer models are powered by an external 12V power supply (for thinness), and could (with a special cable) be connected directly to the computer's power supply, possibly saving power, desk space and wall-outlet space
| No backlight needed, 
can be fabricated on flexible plastic substrates for flexible displays
| Screen-door effects are more noticeable than LCD when up close, or on larger sizes;
fragile and required to be upright to avoid screen collapse
|-
! Response time
| Sub-milisecond
| 1–8 ms typical (according to manufacturer data), older units could be as slow as 35 ms
| Sub-millisecond
| Sub-millisecond
|-
! Screen burn-in
| Yes, the reason screensavers became popular
| Discoloring may occur due to thermalization, but usually it is not permanent;
dead or stuck pixels may occur in manufacturing or usage
| Yes, dead or stuck pixels may occur in manufacturing or usage
| Severe in early models, dead or stuck pixels may occur in manufacturing or usage
|-
! Size
| Bulky depth, 
7" smallest possible for color screen, 
over 40" is very heavy
| Compact, 
can be manufactured almost any size and shape, 
very thin allowing mounted distance to user for less focusing-related eyestrain
| Compact, can be made in nearly any size or shape.
| Up to 150"(3.8m)
|-
! Weight
| Heavy, especially for larger units, a 20 inches (51 cm) screen weighs about 50 pounds (23 kg)
| Light
| Very light
| Heavy, however, less weight gain per size increase
