! -l
| In European Portuguese syllable-final /l/ is velarized [[[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|ɫ]]] as in Catalan (see dark l), while in most Brazilian dialects and some rural European ones it is vocalized to [[[labio-velar approximant|w]]]. Caipira rhoticizes to English-like ar, while portunhol da pampa velarizes it.

! b
| In Spanish and European Portuguese /b/ is lenited after a continuant.

| [b ~ β]

! d
| In Spanish and European Portuguese /d/ is lenited after a continuant.
In all Portuguese dialects, the consonants /t/ and /d/ have affricate allophones, happening when before a palatalizing /i/ (dʒi ~ dʑi]dʑ, tʃi ~ tɕi]tɕ, mainly in Brazil), or an elided /ɨ/ ~ /e̞/ ~ /ɪ/ or unstressed /i/ before another (that actually becomes /ɨ/ in Portugal), stressed one, leading to sandhi ([[[voiced alveolar sibilant affricate|dz]]]dz, [[[voiceless alveolar sibilant affricate|ts]]]ts, [tVs] → [ts], both in Brazil and Portugal).

! g
| In Spanish and European Portuguese /ɡ/ is lenited after a continuant.

! r-, -rr-
| In Portuguese, r- and -rr- have several possible pronunciations. In most dialects, it is a guttural r ([ʀ], [ʁ] and [χ] in Portugal and Brazil, [x], [ɣ], [ħ], [h] and [ɦ] in Brazil), while in rural northern Portugal and southern Brazil it is a trilled r [[[alveolar trill|r]]] (like in Galician). In some southern and western Brazilian dialects word final -r may be a tap (as in Portugal and Galicia), though English-like [[[alveolar approximant|ɹ]]], [[[retroflex approximant|ɻ]]] or [[[r-colored vowel|ɚ]]] is more common, while in northern and eastern dialects it is guttural. In Spanish, r- and -rr- have kept their original pronunciation as an alveolar trill [[[alveolar trill|r]]]. Intervocalic -r- is an alveolar tap in both languages [[[alveolar flap|ɾ]]].

! v
| Originally, the letters ⟨b⟩ and ⟨v⟩ stood for distinct sounds pronounced [[[voiced bilabial stop|b]]] and [[[voiced bilabial fricative|β]]], respectively, but the two eventually merged into a single phoneme in Spanish. In most varieties of Portuguese they remained separate phonemes, and the bilabial fricative [β] of Old Portuguese subsequently changed into the labiodental fricative [[[voiced labiodental fricative|v]]], as in French and Italian.
