| Breatain (Britain) is the same in both, but "little" Breatain is different in each: Brittany in Scottish and Wales in Irish. The Scottish Gaelic equivalent for Wales is A' Chuimrigh, a Gaelicisation of an Anglicisation of the Welsh Cymru. The Irish for Brittany is An Bhriotáin from Latin "Britannia".
