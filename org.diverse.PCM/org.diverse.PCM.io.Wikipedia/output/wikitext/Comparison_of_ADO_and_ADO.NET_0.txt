! Business Model
| Connection-oriented Models used mostly
| Disconnected models are used:Message-like Models.
|-
! Connection Model
| Client application needs to be connected always to data-server while working on the data, unless using client-side cursors or a disconnected Record set
| Client disconnected as soon as the data is processed. DataSet is disconnected at all times.
|-
! Control of data access behaviors
| Includes implicit behaviors that may not always be required in an application and that may therefore limit performance.
| Provides well-defined, factored components with predictable behavior, performance, and semantics.
|-
! Data Passing
| ADO objects communicate in binary mode.
| ADO.NET uses XML for passing the data.
|-
! Design-time support
| Derives information about data implicitly at run time, based on metadata that is often expensive to obtain.
| Leverages known metadata at design time in order to provide better run-time performance and more consistent run-time behavior.
|-
! Disconnected Access
| Provided by Record set
| Provided by Data Adapter and Data set
|-
! XML Support
| Limited
| Robust Support
