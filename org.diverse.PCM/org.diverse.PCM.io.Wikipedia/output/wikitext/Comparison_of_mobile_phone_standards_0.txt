! Frequency utilization/Call density
| 0.2 MHz = 8 timeslots. Each timeslot can hold up to 2 calls (4 calls with VAMOS) through interleaving.
| 1.228  MHz = 3Mbit/s
| Lower than CDMA-2000?
| 
| Very low density
| 5 MHz = 2 Mbit/s. 42Mbit/s for HSPA+. Each call uses 1.8-12 kbit/s depending on chosen quality and audio complexity.
