! Java

! C++ is compiled directly to machine code which is then executed directly by the central processing unit.
| Java is compiled to byte-code which the Java virtual machine (JVM) then interprets at runtime. Actual Java implementations do Just-in-time compilation to native machine code. Alternatively, the GNU Compiler for Java can compile directly to machine code.
