! returns integer.

! Description
| Compares two strings to each other.  If they are equivalent, a zero is returned. Otherwise, most of these routines will return a positive or negative result corresponding to whether string is lexicographically greater than, or less than, respectively, than string. The exceptions are the Scheme and REXX routines which return the index of the first mismatch.
