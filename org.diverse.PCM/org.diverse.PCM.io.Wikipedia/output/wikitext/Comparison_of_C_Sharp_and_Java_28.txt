! Notes for the Java implementation: Ruby accessors names are generated from the attribute name with a  suffix. When assigning values, Java developers must use the Ruby accessor method name.
 Dynamic objects from a foreign language are not first-class objects in that they must be manipulated through an API.
| 
| Notes for the C# implementation: Objects returned from properties or methods of  objects are themselves of  type. When type inference (the  keyword) is used, the variables calc and answer are inferred dynamic/late-bound.
 Dynamic, late-bounds objects are first-class citizens that can be manipulated using C# syntax even though they have been created by an external language.
 is a reserved word. The  prefix allows keywords to be used as identifiers.
