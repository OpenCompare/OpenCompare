| Truncate
| 
| Extremely conservative list of single IP4 addresses that produce exclusively spam/malware as indicated by the GBUdb IP Reputation system. Most systems should be able to safely reject connections based on this list.
| Automatic: Continuous while reputation statistics remain bad. Warning: Produces false positives, and has no remedy/removal process. IPs are dropped quickly if the statistics improve (within an hour). IPs are dropped within 36 hours (typ) if no more messages are seen (dead zombie).
| Automatic: IPs are added when the GBUdb "cloud" statistics reach a probability figure that indicates 95% of messages produce a spam/malware pattern match and a confidence figure that indicates sufficient data to trust the probability data.
| Source data is derived from a global network of Message Sniffer filtering nodes in real-time. Truncate data is updated from statistics every 10 minutes.
