            Depends; as of 2013, most LCDs use PWM (strobing) to dim the backlight which can cause severe eyestrain for some people although the flicker isn't visible because it is normally done at 200 Hz or faster

            No native resolution. Currently, the only display technology capable of multi-syncing (displaying different resolutions and refresh rates without the need for scaling). Display lag is extremely low due to its nature, which does not have the ability to store image data before output, unlike LCDs, plasma displays and OLED displays.

            The LCD grid can mask effects of spatial and grayscale quantization, creating the illusion of higher image quality.

            Many newer models are powered by an external 12V power supply (for thinness), and could (with a special cable) be connected directly to the computer's power supply, possibly saving power, desk space and wall-outlet space
