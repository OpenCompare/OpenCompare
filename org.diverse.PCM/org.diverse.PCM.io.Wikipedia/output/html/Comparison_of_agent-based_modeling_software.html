Using the JNI (Java Native Interface) technique, it should be possible to develop agents written in C or C++. It is also possible to embed Java agents in C/C++ applications using the same technique, using JNI as a glue between the two worlds.

            Sim++ can be used with C code or C++ code, but you MUST have a C++ compiler. DOS; Windows (as a DOS application) or OS2 (as a DOS app). The SimPack software is currently being overhauled to use C++ exclusively; however, it will still be possible to use C programs, as before, to access the C++ routines.
