==35 mm==
The [[35 mm film]] [[film gauge|gauge]] has long been the most common gauge in professional usage, and thus enjoys the greatest number of cameras currently available for professional usage. The modern era of 35 mm cameras dates to the 1970s, when [[Arri]]'s [[Arriflex 35BL]] and [[Panavision]]'s original [[Panaflex]] models emerged as the first self-blimped, lightweight cameras. Another distinguishing characteristic of modern cameras is the adoption of stronger [[lens mount]] seatings secured with a [[breech lock]] - namely the [[Arri PL]] and [[PV mount]], both of which were designs descended from the [[BNCR mount]] of Mitchell cameras. 

===General===
*'''Camera model''' - specific camera body models and variants, usually officially authorized
*'''Camera line''' - either the body family (similar bodies) or system family (complementary design)
*'''Manufacturer''' - company of origin
*'''Introduced''' - first year of known usage
*'''Weight''' - usually just the body, but may include accessories as mentioned
*'''MOS/Sync''' - Sync-sound cameras are able to both maintain a constant speed (usually [[crystal oscillator|crystal lock]]) and run quietly enough not to be heard by the sound recordist. [[MOS (film)|MOS]] cameras do not meet either one or both of these requirements, and are usually used either for applications where camera noise is not a concern, or non-standard camera speeds are required. A camera is also deemed MOS if it can not hold a constant speed, regardless of its noise levels.
*'''Noise level''' - measured noise made by the camera, usually without film and at a given distance of several feet. MOS cameras do not have a noise level since they are not intended to be used with recorded sound and thus are much louder.

:''A limited number of cameras prior to the modern period are listed due to their prevalence in special applications.''

===Lens and gate aperture===
*'''Lens mount''' - the type of [[lens mount|mount]] required for using the camera. Certain lenses may not be able to be used with particular cameras if the mounts are incompatible.
*'''Super 35?''' - is the mount capable of quickly being converted to [[Super 35]] centering? This is a horizontal shift from [[Academy ratio|Academy]] centering. Cameras not designed for this may need to otherwise disassemble the entire hard front to re-align.
*'''Aperture size''' - the size of the aperture of the gate.
*'''Aperture plate''' - is the gate removable for inspection and what accessories may it have?
*'''Lens interface''' - electronic information system located in the lens mount to communicate lens data to the camera and accessories.
*'''Ground glass''' - interchangeable [[ground glass]]es allow for the viewfinder to display whichever [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] is being framed for.
*'''Frameline glow''' - can the camera make the framelines glow for easier viewing in low-light conditions?

===Shutter===
*'''Reflex''' - is the shutter a [[reflex mirror]] design?
*'''Design''' - [[rotary disc shutter]]s have two common designs - a "half-moon" disc of 180° or "butterfly" of two 90° segments opposite each other which spins at half-speed.
*'''Location''' - where the shutter is centered
*'''Adjustment''' - how the shutter angle can be adjusted. Most manual designs can only be adjusted when the camera isn't running, often with the lens removed. All electronic shutters allow adjustment at all times, including when the camera is running.
*'''Angles''' - shutter angles available and in what increments or stops, if not continuous

===Movement===
* '''Movement type''' - design of the movement mechanism
* '''Pulldown claws''' - number of claws which engage the [[film perforations]] to transport the film while the shutter is closed. Some claws may have more than one pin in order to engage multiple perfs at a time.
* '''Registration pins''' - number of pins which engage the film perforations during exposure in order to ensure consistent image stability from frame to frame.
* '''Frame rate (forward)''' - range of speeds in frame/s (frames per second) and smallest increments of change allowed. Accessories noted where required for certain speeds.
* '''Frame rate (reverse)''' - range of speeds in frame/s (frames per second) and smallest increments of change allowed. Accessories noted where required for certain speeds.
* '''Motor''' - type of motor, voltage, crystal-controlled speeds ([[Crystal oscillator|Xtal]])
* '''Pulldown''' - [[negative pulldown]] options available
* '''Pitch control?''' - does the camera allow for adjustment of the pulldown claw to optimize camera noise and avoid perforation damage?

==16 mm==
[[16 mm film]] occupies a rather curious position within filmmaking - with a wide range encompassing virtually every field - amateur home movies, student films, experimental films, television work, commercials, music videos, corporate films, industrial research, medical applications, and lower budget features. Its robust image quality in relation to its size allows for a much more versatile, accessible, and affordable usage in many fields where neither 35 mm nor [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] would be well-suited. Despite current challenges from the burgeoning digital video market, the consistent improvement of cameras, lenses, and film stocks have enabled the [[16 mm film|Super 16]] format to flourish recently, with many labs reporting increased usage. The modern era of 16 mm cameras is concurrent with that of 35 mm for both the same reasons as 35 mm as well as an additional change: the creation of the Super 16 format by Rune Ericsson in 1971. The format expanded the usable film negative horizontally, which required a larger [[film gate]] and necessitated either specialized conversion of machined parts or purchase of new cameras designed with Super 16 gates. Since the format took more than a decade to slowly standardize, the competition from both high and low end video cameras has decimated the demand for 16 mm cameras for most non-professional usage. Therefore there are relatively few Super 16 cameras, although most are considered professional-grade.
