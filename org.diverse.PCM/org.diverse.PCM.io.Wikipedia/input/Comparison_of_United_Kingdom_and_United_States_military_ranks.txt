Not listed are U.S. [[Warrant Officer (United States)|warrant officers]].  A warrant officer is an officer who can and does command, carry out military justice actions and sits on both selection and promotion boards. A US warrant officer is a single-track specialty officer, initially appointed by the US Secretary of the Army; he/she receives a commission upon promotion to Chief Warrant Officer Two (CW2).

In the UK the separation between 'other' ranks and 'officer' ranks can on occasion become permeable. Notably, within the British armed services, both [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Sir Fitzroy Maclean]] and [[Enoch Powell]] are examples of, rare, rapid career progression with the British army, both rising from the rank of Private to Brigadier during World War II. In the US military such advancement is not uncommon, all four services maintaining programs that select promising enlisted men for the commissioned ranks.
 
'''Notes to table above'''
#The Royal Marines rank alongside their army equivalents. However, when borne on the books of any of HM Ships or Naval Establishments Royal Marines are subject to the Naval Discipline Act 1957; in those circumstances, many officer ranks in the Royal Marines formerly enjoyed greater status. [[Second Lieutenant]]s were equivalent to [[Sub Lieutenant]]s and ranks from [[Lieutenant]] to [[Major]] were considered equivalent to one rank higher (OF-2 to OF-4). [[Lieutenant Colonel]]s were considered equivalent to [[Royal Navy|RN]] [[Captain (naval)|Captains]] with less than six years in the rank, and [[Colonel]]s were equivalent to [[Captain (naval)|Captains]] with more than six years seniority. Higher ranks followed the equivalence on the table above. This state of affairs ended on 1 July 1999, when Royal Marine officer ranks were fully aligned with those of the Army.
#RAF-style ranks are also used by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]], [[Nigerian Air Force]], [[Indian Air Force]], [[Pakistan Air Force]], [[Bangladesh Air Force]], [[Hellenic Air Force]], [[Egyptian Air Force]], [[Trinidad and Tobago Air Guard]], [[Royal Air Force of Oman]] and [[Sri Lanka Air Force]]. The [[Ghana Air Force]] and [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]] (previously [[Royal Rhodesian Air Force]]) also use the same basic system, but replace Pilot Officer and Flying Officer with Air Sub Lieutenant and Air Lieutenant. The [[Royal Thai Air Force]] uses the RAF ranks also.  The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and [[Royal Malaysian Air Force]] also previously used the system.
#Note that the U.S. military usually uses O-1 to O-10 to symbolize officers, and not the NATO codes of OF-1 to OF-10 in which all subaltern officers are classed as OF-1 (O-1 and O-2 in US). O-11 is sometimes used for the U.S. OF-10 ranks, but is not official.
#OF-10 ranks in the United States can only be attained during war time; the last five-star officer died in 1981. This is also now generally the case in the UK, although provision is made to award them under special circumstances in peacetime (no promotions to these ranks have been made since they were generally suspended in 1997). Captain-General Royal Marines is a ceremonial rank, usually held by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|a member]] of the Royal Family.
#Due to its modern day size, the ranks of General and Lieutenant-General are not used within 3 Commando Brigade or the main Royal Marines. The role of [[Commandant General Royal Marines|Commandant General]] being held by a Major-General. However, RM officers have held the rank of Lieutenant-General, serving in MOD or Joint Forces positions.
#At various times the O-7 rank in the USN has been called "Commodore" and "Commodore Admiral"
#Not used in the Royal Marines. Royal Marines officers join as Second Lieutenants; after two years service, provided that Phase 2 training has been successfully completed, they are promoted to the rank of Lieutenant (if under 21 at the time of joining) or Captain (if 21 or older at the time of joining).
#No longer used in the Royal Navy. Officers join [[BRNC Dartmouth]] as Midshipmen (if non-graduates) or Sub-Lieutenants (if graduates), but use the non-substantive rank of Officer Cadet (OCdt) during the pre-Initial Sea Training phase.
#Depending on the particular Officer Commissioning Program. [[U.S. Naval Academy|Naval Academy]], [[U.S. Merchant Marine Academy|Merchant Marine Academy]] and [[NROTC]] are Midshipmen (MIDN); [[U.S. Coast Guard Academy]] are Cadets; U.S. Navy Seaman-to-Admiral 21 (STA-21) and [[Officer Candidate School]] are Officer Candidates (OC).

==US "Enlisted" and UK "Other" ranks compared==

The British Armed Forces do not use the term Enlisted Ranks. The equivalent in the Royal Navy is Ratings and in the other services is [[Other ranks (UK)|Other Ranks]] (divided into Warrant Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and Soldiers or Airmen).

UK and US ranks are categorised in the NATO rank code system OR-1 to OR-9. Ranks with the same code are equivalent. Within the US military, however, "E-1" to "E-9" is the more common usage.

'''''Notes on comparison:''' 
*''In the US Army OR-1 to OR-4a (Specialist) are junior enlisted, OR-4b (Corporal) to OR-6 are Junior Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs), and OR-7 to OR-9 are Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs).
*''In the USAF OR-1 to OR-4 are junior enlisted, OR-5 to OR-6 are NCOs, and OR-7 to OR-9 are SNCOs.
*''In the USMC, OR-1 to OR-3 are junior enlisted, OR-4 to OR-5 are NCOs, and OR-6 to OR-9 are Staff Non-Commissioned Officers.
*''In the US Navy and Coast Guard, OR-1 to OR-3 or "nonrated (wo)men" are junior enlisted, OR-4 to OR-6 or Petty Officers are NCOs, and OR-7 to OR-9 or Chief Petty Officers are SNCOs.''
*''Generally speaking, the RN assumes a rank up despite the NATO code remaining the same. For example, a LH is more practically comparable to a PO2 or PO1 in the USN.
Addendum: In the US Army (but not the USMC) the term "Trooper/(Troop)" may be used informally for lower enlisted in Cavalry, Scout, Airborne, Air Assault, Ranger, and Special Forces Units, along with the occasional use for any soldier, particularly dismounted Infantry. The specific definition of "Troop" is a company sized unit of Cavalry, organizationally equivalent to "Battery" in Artillery units.

'''Notes to table above'''

# A [[Warrant Officer]] in UK service is a senior non-commissioned rank not comparable to the various grades of Warrant Officer in the US, although holding the Queen's Warrant and with certain privileges similar to those of officers.  In the Army and Royal Marines, they are referred to by their appointment, of which there are many (for example, [[Regimental Sergeant Major]] is a WO1 appointment).  The US rank is held by single track career specialists (ranking between Enlisted Ranks and 2nd Lieutenant) and have no NATO equivalent. A RN Warrant Officer Class 1 incorporated the former rank of Fleet Chief Petty Officer. There are now Executive Warrant Officers, denoting the senior WO1s on ships and shore establishments. There are four Command Warrant Officers in the RN. The most senior Royal Navy WO1 is the Warrant Officer of the Naval Service (WONS) By 2014, the rating of WO2 will disappear and there will be a single WO rate, that is, WO1.
# RAF Flight Sergeants: Although technically equivalent to British Army Staff Sergeant this does not equate to time served or experience since the RAF does not have the rank of WO2.
# The RN created the rate of Warrant Officer Class 2 on 1 April 2004. Previously, there was a rate of Charge Chief Petty Officer, who usually ranked as OR-7, although above other CPOs. A Charge Chief Artificer (a highly qualified technical CCPO) could be given a NATO OR-8 status, but still ranked below WO2 in the Army and Royal Marines. On the creation of WO2, all CCPOs were upgraded to this rate.By 2014, the rating of WO2 in the RN will disappear and there will be a single WO rate, that is, WO1.
# In the US "OR #" system, NCOs are from OR4 onwards hence the equivalents in rank name do not tie in exactly. In the US Army a Corporal is considered an NCO, but a Specialist is not.
# British Sergeants/Petty Officers are seen as equal to E5 ''and'' E6 although Corporals ''as well as'' Sergeants may be appointed to an official OR-5 (i.e. E-5) military role as is suited to the particular situation.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i>[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|<span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2013)">citation needed</span>]]</i>&#93;</sup>
# From April 1, 1999 Able Rating and Ordinary Rating merged and the rate Operator Maintainer was created to replace them, Marine 1st Class and Marine 2nd Class merged, and Junior Rating and Junior Marine were abolished.
