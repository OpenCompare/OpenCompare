==Comparison==

=== Software support ===

==== Flash ====

Web browsers cannot render Flash media themselves, instead it is rendered primarily using the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] but freely available [[Adobe Flash Player]]. Until 2008, there was no official specification which was allowed to be used to create an alternative player. Alternative players have been developed before 2008, but they support Flash to a lesser degree than the official one.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/manual/gnashref.html#runs-on |title=Gnash Reference Manual |publisher=Gnu.org |date=2008-05-18 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref>

The latest version of the Adobe Flash Player runs on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Research In Motion|RIM]], [[QNX]] and [[Google TV]].

Earlier versions run on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.2-4.0.x (Flash has been released for 4.0, but Adobe has announced that they will discontinue support for Android 4.1 and higher.<ref name="Adobe Flash coming for ICS, not Android 5.0">{{cite journal

}}</ref>) (Flash 11.2), [[PlayStation 3]] (Flash 9), [[PSP]] (Flash 6). [[Adobe Flash Lite]] runs on [[Wii]], [[Symbian]], [[Maemo]] Linux, [[Windows Mobile]], and [[Chumby]].

Apple does not allow Flash to run on [[iOS]], the operating system which runs on [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]] and [[Apple TV]]. Apple stated that it has no plans to do so.<ref name="thoughtsFlash"/>

In February 2012, Adobe announced it would discontinue development of Flash Player on Linux for all browsers except Google Chrome by dropping the support for [[NPAPI]] and using only Chrome’s [[PPAPI]].<ref name="pcworld-linux-ppapi" /><ref name="slashdot-linux-ppapi" />

==== HTML 5 ====
All web browsers support [[HTML]] and other [[Web standards]] to various degree.

<!-- need to replace this with list of browser HTML5 compatibility -->
{{As of|2013|12}} versions of browsers such as [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[Firefox]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] implement HTML5 to a considerable degree. However, some portions of the HTML5 specification are still being implemented by browser makers.

=== Vendor neutrality ===
Until 2008, the use of Flash was covered by restrictive licenses. The conditions prohibited use of the specification to develop any software (including players) which could render or read (and thus convert) SWF files, and required the output SWF files to be compatible with Adobe’s players.<ref>{{cite web

Flash is not an [[open standard]]{{spaced ndash}}it is controlled by [[Adobe Systems]]{{spaced ndash}}whereas HTML5 is largely controlled by a committee ([[WHATWG]]) made up of three companies{{spaced ndash}}[[Opera Software]], the [[Mozilla Foundation]], and Apple.<ref name="thoughtsFlash">{{cite web

Various people have praised Flash over the years for rendering consistently across platforms. Constructing sites in Flash is a way to prevent ''code forking,'' whereby different versions of a site are created for different browsers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ka Wai Cheung and Craig Bryant |title=Flash Application Design Solutions: The Flash Usability Handbook |page= 6 |publisher=Apress |year= 2006 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=49OwlbrMc-oC&pg=PA6&dq=flash+cross+browser&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cI-hUNeJAu75igLOloGIBg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Rob |last=Huddleston |title=Flash Catalyst CS5 Bible |publisher=Wiley |year= 2010 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=crN1zsYwYAYC&pg=PT39&dq=flash+cross+browser&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SZKhUICyLcr2iwKh7YFo&ved=0CEkQ6wEwCA}}</ref>

Speaking at 'Adobe Max' in 2011, Itai Asseo likewise said that, unlike HTML 5, Flash offers a way to develop applications that work across platforms. HTML 5, he said, is currently implemented differently (if at all) by different browsers. Although the Flash browser plugin is not supported on the Apple iPhone OS, Flash applications can be exported to Adobe AIR, which runs on that operating system as a native application. In the same talk, Mr. Asseo lamented the return to another browser war (as seen in the late 1990s). If Flash falls out of favor, he said, web developers will either have to develop many different versions of their web sites and native applications to take into account different HTML 5 implementations, deny access to browsers that do not support their version of HTML, or dramatically reduce the functionality of their sites in order to deliver content to the least-advanced browser.<ref>{{cite web|author=Itai Asseo|title=The Death of Flash|url=http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2011-envision/the-death-of-flash/|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}</ref>

=== Authoring ===
Constructing Flash websites using Adobe tools is relatively easier than with integrated development environments for CSS, HTML, and JavaScript;<ref name=caseFlash/> however, many of Adobe's tools are expensive and [[proprietary software]].<ref name=caseFlash/>

Tools for HTML5 are just starting to come to market; in the meantime, Adobe has released a first version of a Flash-to-HTML5 conversion tool for existing content<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2011/03/wallaby-flash-to-html5-conversion-tool-now-available.html |title=John Nack on Adobe : "Wallaby" Flash-to-HTML5 conversion tool now available |publisher=Blogs.adobe.com |date=2011-03-07 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> and are working on creating new tooling for HTML5 as well, like [[Adobe Edge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/adobe-edge-html5-animation-tool/16741/ |title=Adobe previews its Edge HTML5 animation tool |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=2010-10-26 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

Because HTML5 is an open format, tools like those for Flash can be built for it, too. Applications like Hype<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tumultco.com/hype/features/ |title=Hype Features |publisher=Tumultco.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref> and [[Adobe Edge]] are already on the market.

Some users{{spaced ndash}}especially those on [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]]{{spaced ndash}}have complained about the relatively high [[CPU time|CPU usage]] of Flash for video playback.<ref>"Flash{{spaced ndash}}CPU Usage{{spaced ndash}}FPS{{spaced ndash}}Frame Rate."

Reader discussions, Adobe Support Forums. 10 December 2010]</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=December 2010}} This was partially because the Flash plugin did not use the GPU to render video. Adobe has responded to some of those criticisms in the 10.1 and 10.2 releases of the Flash plugin by offloading H.264 video decoding to dedicated hardware and by introducing a new video API called Stage Video.<ref>{{cite web

But older websites that use ActionScript 2.0 will not benefit from this.<ref>{{cite web

An HTML vs Flash comparison in 2010 listed non-Flash technologies as being slower than Flash when used for non-video animations,<ref>{{cite web|title="HTML5" versus Flash: Animation Benchmarking - HTML 5 Slower Than Flash|url=http://themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2010/03/22/}}</ref> but in January 2012 some of them were faster.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flash vs HTML5 Performance (Updated January 2012)|url=http://pacoup.com/2011/02/03/flash-vs-html5-performance/}}</ref>

=== Features ===
Flash has the ability to specify measurements in sub-pixel increments. This can result in a crisper and generally more pleasant appearance of Flash web sites. When confronted with CSS and HTML measurements on a sub-pixel scale, web browsers will round either up or down, depending on the browser, which leads to inconsistency and unreliability in the display of those pages.<ref name="caseFlash">{{cite news

Flash offers webcam support, while HTML and related technologies did not until recently.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}

There are, however, people working on adding "device support" (device API) to the HTML5 specification, which would allow for videoconferencing, access to webcams, microphones, USB-thumbdrives and other USB- or serial devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ajaxian.com/archives/video-conferencing-with-the-html5-device-element |title=Video Conferencing with the HTML5 Device Element |publisher=Ajaxian |date=2010-09-20 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/ |title=HTML Standard |publisher=Whatwg.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

==== DRM ====
Flash includes [[digital rights management|DRM]] support.

HTML5 does not include any [[digital rights management]] functionality. Implementations can support DRM outside the scope of HTML, for example in [[codec]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/html/wiki/FAQs#Is_there_support_for_digital_rights_management_.28DRM.29_in_HTML5_video.3F |title=FAQs - HTML Wiki |publisher=W3.org |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> The proposal to add DRM features to HTML5 itself has been criticised by those who consider openness and vendor-neutrality (both server- and client-side) one of the most important properties of HTML, because DRM is incompatible with [[free software]],<ref>{{cite web

=== Accessibility ===
Both Flash and HTML text can be read by screen readers. However, special care must be taken to ensure Flash movies are read correctly. For example, if a Flash movie is set to repeat indefinitely, this can cause a screen reader to repeat the content endlessly. Selecting the "Make object accessible" check box in Adobe Flash Professional will create a text-only version of the object for screen readers. It will also hide any motion from the screen reader.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/flash/animation.html|title=Adobe Flash accessibility design guidelines|publisher=Adobe Systems|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref> Since Flash content is usually placed on a single webpage, it appears as a single entry in search engine result pages, unless techniques like [[deep linking]] are used with libraries like [[SWFAddress]] to provide multiple links within Flash websites and web applications. [[graphical user interface|User interface widgets]] in Flash objects don't always behave like their host native counterparts. Keyboard, mouse and other accessibility shortcuts may not work unless the webpage developer explicitly adds support for it.

=== Search engines ===

Both Flash content and HTML content can be indexed by Google, Yahoo!, and Bing, although bi-directional text (e.g.[[Arabic]], [[Hebrew]]) is not supported by Google.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=72746#1|title=Flash and other rich media files|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/07/google-yahoo-spiders-can-now-crawl-through-flash-sites.ars|title=Google, Yahoo spiders can now crawl through Flash sites|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref> Yahoo! added support for indexing Flash sites in 2008, although Google had been able to index them for several years before that. Bing added support for Flash sites in 2010.

=== iOS devices ===
