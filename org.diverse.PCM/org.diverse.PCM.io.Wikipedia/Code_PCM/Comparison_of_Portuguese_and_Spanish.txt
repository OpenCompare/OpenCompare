Although '''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]''' and '''[[Spanish language|Spanish]]''' are closely related, to the point of having a considerable degree of [[mutual intelligibility]], there are also important differences between them, which can pose difficulties for people acquainted with one of the languages who attempt to learn the other. Both are part of a broader group known as [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance]], which also includes several other languages or dialects with fewer speakers, all of which are mutually intelligible to some degree.

The most obvious differences are in pronunciation.  The written languages are often significantly more intercomprehensible than the spoken languages.  Compare, for example, the phrase
:''A buen entendedor pocas palabras bastan'' (Spanish {{IPA|[a ˈβwen entendeˈðor ˈpokas paˈlaβɾas ˈbastan]}})
:''Para bom entendedor, uma palavra basta'' (European Portuguese {{IPA|[p(ə)ɾə ˈβõ ẽtẽdɨˈðoɾ ˈ(w)məʃ pəˈlavɾə ˈβaʃtə]}}, Brazilian Portuguese {{IPA|[paɾə ˈbõw ĩtẽdeˈdoʁ ˈpoːkɐs pɐˈlavɾɐz ˈbastɐ̃w]}})
roughly equivalent to the English proverb "A word to the wise is sufficient."

There are also some significant differences between [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[European Portuguese]] as there are between [[American and British English differences|British and American English]] or [[Peninsular Spanish|Peninsular]] and [[Latin American Spanish]]. This article notes these differences below only where: 
* both Brazilian and European Portuguese differ not only from each other, but from Spanish as well;
* both Peninsular (i.e., European) and Latin American Spanish differ not only from each other, but also from Portuguese; or
* either Brazilian or European Portuguese differs from Spanish with [[syntax]] not possible in Spanish (while the other dialect does not).

Portuguese and Spanish share a great number of words that are either spelled identically (although they may be pronounced quite differently), almost identically (though they may be pronounced more or less the same), or are similarly predictable. Consider, for example, the following paragraph, taken from the {{lang|es|''Gramática esencial del español''}}, by Manuel Seco (Espasa Calpe, 1989), and compare it to the Portuguese rendition below, noting the extensive lexical similarity and the only slight changes in word order:

<blockquote>''Pero, a pesar de esta variedad de posibilidades que la voz posee, sería un muy pobre instrumento de comunicación si no contara más que con ella. La capacidad de expresión del hombre no dispondría de más medios que la de los animales. La voz, sola, es para el hombre apenas una materia informe, que para convertirse en un instrumento perfecto de comunicación debe ser sometida a un cierto tratamiento. Esa manipulación que recibe la voz son las "articulaciones".''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Porém, apesar desta variedade de possibilidades que a voz possui, seria um instrumento de comunicação muito pobre se não se contasse com mais do que ela. A capacidade de expressão do homem não disporia de mais meios que a dos animais. A voz, sozinha, é para o homem apenas uma matéria informe, que para se converter num instrumento perfeito de comunicação deve ser submetida a um certo tratamento. Essa manipulação que a voz recebe são as "articulações".''</blockquote>

Some common words are however quite different in the two languages, for instance:

|}

==Vocabulary==

===Overview===
Vocabulary differences between the two languages arose from various factors:

* Arabic influence: Spanish kept much of the [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] vocabulary of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin, while the Mozarabic component was far less influential in Portuguese. Thus we find cases in which the usual Spanish word is derived from Arabic, while the corresponding word in Portuguese is Latin-derived, as in the following examples: Sp. ''albañil'', Port. ''pedreiro'', 'stonemason'; Sp. ''alcalde'', Port. ''presidente da câmara'' (Portugal)/''prefeito'' (Brasil), 'mayor'; Sp. ''alfarero'', Port. ''oleiro'', 'potter'; Sp. ''alfil''/, Port. ''bispo'', 'bishop' (in chess; otherwise the Spanish word is ''obispo''). In some of these cases Spanish may have a less-frequent synonym derived from Latin, and Portuguese may have one from Arabic. 
* Influences from other [[Europe]]an languages during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Portuguese received a great deal of [[French language|French]] influence, while Spanish was more autonomous and Mediterranean-oriented.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
* Influences from other languages ([[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]], [[African languages|African]], or Asian). For example, compare the respective Spanish and Portuguese main words for:
:: '[[Pineapple#The name|pineapple]]': ''piña'' (from the Spanish word for 'pine cone') / ''abacaxi'' (from [[Tupian languages|Tupi]]) or ''ananás'' (''ananás'' or ''ananá'' also in Spanish, though less common)
:::(from [[Tupi–Guarani languages|Tupi–Guarani]]), in Spanish by way of Portuguese.
::'[[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]]':  ''pipa'' (from supposed Late Latin {{sm|pīpa}}) / ''cachimbo'' (from [[Kimbundu language|Kimbundu]]).<ref>Cândido Figueiredo, ''Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa'' (Rio de Janeiro: Mérito: 1949); Francisco da Silveira Bueno, ''Grande Dicionário Etimológico-Prosódico da Língua Portuguesa'' (São Paulo: Saraiva, 1964).</ref>
:: '[[Tea#Etymology and cognates in other languages|tea]]': ''té'' (from [[Min Nan]] Chinese) / ''chá'' (from [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]]).
* [[Semantic change]], producing numerous [[cognate]]s that look similar but mean different things (false friends): ''diseñar'' means 'to design' in Spanish, while its cognate ''desenhar'' means 'to draw' in Portuguese. Similarly, ''dibujo'' is Spanish for 'drawing', but ''debuxo'' means 'sketch' in Portuguese (although it is rather rare and bookish, having been largely displaced by ''rascunho''; c.f. Spanish ''rasguño'', which means 'scratch').
* Words that have two forms in one language, but just one in the other: Portuguese ''criar'' corresponds to both Spanish ''crear'' 'to create' and ''criar'' 'to raise', while Spanish ''sueño'' corresponds to both Portuguese ''sonho'' 'dream' and ''sono'' 'sleep'.

===Days of the week===
Unlike the other [[Romance language]]s, modern Portuguese does not use the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[planet]]ary system for the days Monday through Friday.  Instead, the weekdays are numerical, and derived from [[Ecclesiastical Latin]].  The word ''feira'' (from Latin {{sm|[[feria]]}}) refers to daily (Roman Catholic) religious celebrations; it is cognate with [[:pt:Feira|''feira'']]  'fair' or 'market', as well as with ''férias'' 'vacation' and ''feriado'' 'holiday'. In Spanish, the days of the week are all masculine; in Portuguese, the ''feira'' days are feminine, while ''sábado'' and ''domingo'' are masculine.

The form ''terça-feira'' (< Lat. {{sm|tertia feria}}) differs in its first component from the usual Portuguese word for 'third', ''terceira''.

In actual usage, the word ''feira'' is often dropped:

:''Vou visitar-te na segunda.'' (European Portuguese)
:''Vou te visitar na segunda.'' (Brazilian and European Portuguese)
:'I'll visit you on Monday.'

===Cognates===
Apart from a considerable number of [[false friend]]s, there are also some cognate words whose meaning is broader in one language than in the other. Some examples:

====''Todo'' and ''tudo''====
The Spanish indefinite pronoun ''todo'' can mean 'all/every', or 'everything'. Portuguese distinguishes between ''todo'' 'all/every' (masculine) and ''tudo'' 'everything' (neuter, used for an indefinite object or abstraction).

:'''''Todos''' los insectos tienen seis patas.'' (Spanish)
:'''''Todos''' os insetos têm seis patas.'' (Portuguese)
:''''All''' insects have six legs.'

:''El ladrón robó '''todo'''.'' (Spanish)
:''O ladrão roubou '''tudo'''.'' (Portuguese)
:'The thief stole '''everything'''' or 'The thief stole '''it all'''.'

====Relative and interrogative pronouns====
Spanish uses an [[acute accent]] on [[interrogative pronoun]]s, while the corresponding [[relative pronoun]]s (etymologically the same words) are spelled without the accent to mark the difference in [[prosodic stress]].<ref>Martínez 2010, p. 135; Veciana 2004, p. 15</ref> (As explained below, the acute accent often changes the vowel sound in Portuguese, but not Spanish.) For example, ''¿quién?'' (who?) and ''quien'' (who) in Spanish, but ''quem'' for both in Portuguese. Apart from that, while ''"quem"'' is invariable, Spanish has both the singular ''"quién"'' and the plural ''"quiénes."''

: ¿Quién'''es''' son esas personas? (Spanish)
: ''Quem são essas pessoas?'' (Portuguese)
: 'Who are those people?'

====''Muy'', ''mucho'', and ''muito''====
Spanish distinguishes the adjective ''mucho'' 'much/many' from the adverb ''muy'' 'very/quite'. Portuguese uses ''muito'' for both (there's also ''mui'', but it is considered old-fashioned)

: ''Tomé '''muchas''' fotos durante el viaje.'' (Spanish)
: ''Tirei '''muitas''' fotos durante a viagem.'' (Portuguese)
: 'I took '''many''' photos during the trip.'

: ''Las cerezas están '''muy''' maduras.'' (Spanish)
: ''As cerejas estão '''muito''' maduras.''  (Portuguese)
: 'The cherries are '''quite''' ripe.'

As an adjective, ''muito'' is [[inflection|inflected]] according to the gender and number of the noun it qualifies, like ''mucho''. As an adverb, it is invariable like ''muy''.  Thus, it would be incorrect to say *''muitas maduras'' in the second example.

====Cardinal numbers====
The cardinal numbers are very similar in Spanish and Portuguese, but there are differences of usage in numbers one and two.  Spanish has different words for the masculine singular indefinite article ('a, an') and the numeral 'one', thus ''un capítulo'' 'a chapter', but ''capítulo uno'' 'chapter one'.  In Portuguese, both words are the same: ''um capítulo'' and ''capítulo um''.  Spanish ''uno'' can also be used as a pronoun, like the English [[one (pronoun)|generic "one"]], to represent an indeterminate subject, but this is not possible with Portuguese ''um''; the reflexive pronoun ''se'' is used instead. ''Se'' may be used in Spanish to form passive and impersonal constructions, as well.<ref>{{cite book |last= Butt |first= John |author2=Carmen Benjamin |title= A New Reference Grammar of Modern Spanish |publisher= [[McGraw-Hill Education]] |location= [[New York City]] |year= 2000 |edition=3rd|isbn= 0-658-00873-0 |page=394 (§28.6) }}</ref>

:'''''Uno''' (''or'' '''Se''') debe pensar antes de actuar.'' (Spanish)
:''Deve-'''se''' pensar antes de agir.'' (Portuguese)
:''''One''' should think before acting.'

This still applies in cases where a relatively indeterminate subject is genderized, such as the Spanish ''todos a una [voz]'' ('all at once', literally 'all at one [voice]'). It should be rewritten in Portuguese without any cardinal number. For example, ''todos juntos'' 'all together'.

On the other hand, in Portuguese, cardinal number 'two' inflects with gender (''dois'' if masculine, ''duas'' if feminine), while in Spanish ''dos'' is used for both.

:''Uno más uno es igual a '''dos'''.'' (Spanish)
:''Um mais um é igual a '''dois'''.'' (Portuguese)
:'One plus one equals '''two'''.'

:'''''Dos''' cabezas piensan mejor que una.'' (Spanish)
:'''''Duas''' cabeças pensam melhor que uma.'' (Portuguese)
:''''Two''' heads think better than one.'

:''Tengo '''dos''' hermanos y '''dos''' hermanas.'' (Spanish)
:''Tenho '''dois''' irmãos e '''duas''' irmãs.'' (Portuguese)
:'I have '''two''' brothers and '''two''' sisters.'

====Conjunctions====
The conjunction "and" in Spanish is ''y'' (pronounced {{IPA|[i]}} before a consonant, {{IPA|[j]}} before a vowel) before all words except those beginning with an {{IPA|[i]}} sound (spelled ''i''- or ''hi''-). Before a syllabic {{IPA|[i]}} sound (and ''not'' the diphthong {{IPA|[je]}} as in ''hierro''), the Spanish conjunction is ''e'' {{IPA|[e̞]}}. Portuguese uses ''e'' {{IPA|[i]}} before all words.

:''Sal '''y''' pimienta.'' (Spanish)
:''Sal '''e''' pimenta.'' (Portuguese)
:'Salt '''and''' pepper.'

:''Judío '''e''' hindú.'' (Spanish)
:''Judeu '''e''' hindu.'' (Portuguese)
:'Jewish '''and''' Hindu.'

:''Leones '''y''' hienas.'' (Spanish)
:''Leões '''e''' hienas.'' (Portuguese)
:'Lions '''and''' hyenas.'

Similarly, for the conjunction "or" Spanish uses ''o'' {{IPA|[o̞]}} before all words except those beginning with ''o''- or ''ho''-, in which case it uses ''u'' {{IPA|[w]}}. Portuguese always uses ''ou'' {{IPA|[ow]}}~{{IPA|[o]}}.

:''Vino '''o''' agua.'' (Spanish)
:''Vinho '''ou''' água.'' (Portuguese)
:'Wine '''or''' water.'

:''Uno '''u''' otro.'' (Spanish)
:''Um '''ou''' outro.'' (Portuguese)
:'One '''or''' the other.'

====''Se'', ''si'', ''sí'', and ''sim''====
In Portuguese, the word ''se'' can be a reflexive pronoun or a conjunction meaning 'if'.  This may give the false impression that a Portuguese verb is [[Reflexive verb|pronominal]] when it is not.  For example, ''Se ficou em Paris...'' means 'If (he/she) remained in Paris...'  When the conjunction ''se'' precedes a pronominal verb, it is common to have a double ''se'' in the sentence, e.g., ''Se se esqueceu da sua senha...''  'If you forgot your password...'

====Miscellaneous====
* Spanish ''largo'' (arch. also ''luengo'') means 'long', while ''ancho'' means 'wide'. In Portuguese ''largo'' (also ''ancho'') is 'wide' and ''longo'' is 'long'.
* Spanish ''extrañar'' can mean 'to find strange' or 'to miss'. Portuguese ''estranhar'' means 'to find strange', or ''to lock horns''.
* Spanish ''raro'' can mean 'rare' or 'strange'. In Portuguese, it just means 'rare'.
* Spanish ''aún'' can mean 'yet/still' and ''todavía'' can mean both 'yet/still' or 'however/nevertheless'. Portuguese ''todavia'' means 'however/nevertheless'. In Portuguese, 'yet/still' is ''ainda''.
* Spanish ''(estar) embarazada'' means '(to be) pregnant'. Portuguese ''(estar) embaraçada'' means '(to be) embarrassed' or '(to be) entangled'.<ref>Curiously, the Portuguese term is the origin of both the Spanish and, via French, the English term, according to [[Encarta#Encarta Dictionary|Microsoft Encarta Dictionary]], 2004. It is formed of ''em'' ('in', as a [[prefix]]), ''baraço'' (an old term for 'rope') and [[suffix]] ''-ada'' (which is the feminine form of a verbal ending equivalent to "-ed"), according to its entry in [[Dicionário Houaiss da Língua Portuguesa|Houaiss Dictionary]].</ref> However, Spanish does have the term ''embarazoso/a'' meaning 'embarrassing'. 'Pregnant' in Portuguese is ''grávida''/''prenha''. In Spanish ''preñada'' is used mainly for pregnant animals but rarely for women.
* Spanish ''exquisito'' means 'exquisite/sophisticated'. Portuguese ''esquisito'' means 'strange/weird'.
* ''Experto'' means 'expert' in both Spanish and Portuguese, but in Portuguese it should not be confused with its [[homophone]] ''esperto'' (it's a homophone only in [[Brazil]]), which means 'smart/intelligent'. 'Expert' in Portuguese may also be ''perito'', ''especialista'', or ''exímio'', which are the same in Spanish (Sp. ''eximio'' is spelled without the accent mark).
* Spanish ''escoba'' is 'broom'. Portuguese ''escova'' is 'brush' or 'broom' (but Portuguese usually chooses 'vassoura' for 'broom'). However, in some varieties of Spanish, ''escobilla'' or ''escobeta'' means 'toilet brush'.
* Spanish ''apellido'' '[[surname]]' is ''apelido'' in European Portuguese, and ''sobrenome'' in both Brazilian and European Portuguese (but Portuguese usually say ''apelido''). Spanish ''sobrenombre''/''apodo'' '[[nickname]]' is ''apelido/alcunha/codinome'' in Brazilian Portuguese, and ''alcunha'' in European Portuguese.
* Spanish ''rojo'' is 'red'. Portuguese ''roxo'' is 'purple'. 'Red' in Portuguese is ''vermelho''. In European Portuguese the word ''encarnado'' (literally ''in the flesh'') is also used as synonym of 'red' even though ''vermelho'' is more frequent.
* Spanish ''apenas'' means 'hardly'. Portuguese ''apenas'' is 'only'. Thus the Spanish phrase ''él apenas pudo dormir'' means 'he could not even/hardly sleep', or 'he was just barely able to sleep', whereas the Portuguese phrase ''ele pôde apenas dormir'' means 'he could only sleep'.
* Spanish ''vaso'' means 'drinking glass (tumbler)', while Portuguese ''vaso'' means ''toilet'' (from ''vaso sanitário'', ''váter'' in Spanish) or ''flower pot''. A 'drinking glass' in Portuguese is ''copo'', while Spanish ''copa'' is a wine glass. A wine glass in Portuguese is ''copo'' or ''taça'', while Spanish ''taza'' is a 'coffee cup or teacup'; Spanish ''taza'' also refers to the bathroom bowl.  'Coffee cup' in Portuguese is ''xícara de café''/''chávena''.
* Spanish ''cachorro'' means [[puppy]], while in Portuguese, it can refer to a dog of any age.

==Grammar==
Broadly speaking, Portuguese and Spanish grammar are not greatly different. Nevertheless, some differences between them can present hurdles to people acquainted with one and learning the other.

===Gender===
Spanish has three forms for the singular [[definite article]], ''el'', masculine, ''la'', feminine, and ''lo'', [[grammatical gender|neuter]]. The last is used with adjectives to form abstract nouns employed in a generic sense, and also to intensify the meaning of adjectives. In Portuguese, there is only ''o'', masculine, and ''a'', feminine. Literary Spanish has also three corresponding third person pronouns, ''él'' 'he', ''ella'' 'she', and ''ello'' 'it' (referring to a broad concept, not a named object), while Portuguese has only ''ele'', masculine, and ''ela'', feminine. The Spanish neuters ''lo'' and ''ello'' have no plural forms.

Some words are masculine in Spanish, but feminine in Portuguese, or vice versa. A common example are nouns ended in ''-aje'' in Spanish, which are masculine, and their Portuguese cognates ending in ''-agem'', which are feminine. For example, Spanish ''el viaje'' 'the journey' (masculine, like French ''le voyage'' and Italian ''il viaggio'') corresponds to the Portuguese feminine ''a viagem''.  Similarly, ''el puente'' 'bridge', ''el dolor'' 'pain', or ''el árbol'' 'tree' are masculine nouns in Modern Spanish, whereas ''a ponte'', ''a dor'', and ''a árvore'' are feminine in Portuguese. On the other hand, the Spanish feminine ''la leche'' 'the milk' corresponds to Portuguese ''o leite'' (masculine, like French ''le lait'', Italian ''il latte''). Likewise, ''nariz'' 'nose' is feminine in Spanish and masculine in Portuguese.

Some Spanish words can be both masculine and feminine, with different meanings. Both meanings usually exist also in Portuguese, but with one and the same gender, so that they can't be differentiated unless further information is provided. For instance, the word ''orden'' 'order' can mean both 'harmonious arrangement' and 'directive', like its counterparts in English and Portuguese. But the Spanish word is masculine when used with the first meaning, and feminine with the second:

:''Me sorprendió '''el''' orden.'' ('I was surprised by '''the''' order [i.e., by how orderly it all was].')
:''Me sorprendió '''la''' orden.'' ('I was surprised by '''the''' order [i.e., by the directive that was given].')

In Portuguese, the equivalent word ''ordem'' is always feminine:

:''Surpreendeu-me '''a''' ordem.'' ('I was surprised by '''the''' order.')
Without additional context, it is impossible to tell which meaning was intended in Portuguese and English (though other words could be substituted; in English, one would likely use ''orderliness'' in the first case above rather than ''order'', which would, by itself, suggest the second case).

===Use of the definite article===
In many varieties of Portuguese, [[personal names]] are normally preceded by a [[definite article]], a trait also found in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] but only in certain dialects in Spanish. In Portuguese, this is a relatively recent development, which some Brazilian dialects have not adopted yet, most notably in some states of the Brazilian Northeast. In those dialects of Portuguese that do regularly use definite articles before proper nouns, the article may be omitted for extra formality, or to show distance in a literary narrative. Compare, for example, English "Mary left", Spanish ''María salió'', and Portuguese ''A Maria saiu''. Note, however, that in many Spanish dialects the definite article is used before personal names; thus, ''la María salió'' is commonly heard.

Portuguese uses the definite article before the names of some cities and almost all countries except relatively new ones, such as ''Cingapura''/''Singapura'' ('Singapore'), and those related to Portugal (or that Portugal has historical relationships with, even though this is a rough rule) and the Portuguese-speaking countries, e.g., ''a Holanda'' but ''Portugal''; ''o México'' but ''Angola'', ''a Suécia'', but ''Moçambique''. The major exception to the country rule is ''o Brasil''. 
In Spanish, use of the definite article is optional with some countries: ''(la) China'', ''(el) Japón'', ''(la) India'', ''(la) Argentina'', ''(el) Ecuador'', ''(el) Perú'', ''(el) Uruguay'', ''(el) Paraguay'', ''(el) Brasil'', ''(los) Estados Unidos'', etc.  The same is true with two continents: ''(la) Antártida'' and ''(el) África''; with archipelagos and islands: ''(las) Filipinas'', ''(las) Canarias'', ''(las) Azores'', with some provinces, regions or territories: ''(el) Tíbet'', ''(la) Toscana'', ''(el) Piamonte'', ''(el) Lacio'' and with some cities: ''(el) Cairo'', ''(la) Valeta''. Spanish uses the definite article with all geographical names when they appear with an adjective or modifying phrase, as in the following examples: ''la España medieval'' 'medieval Spain', ''el Puerto Rico prehispánico'' 'pre-Hispanic Puerto Rico', ''el Portugal de Salazar'' 'Portugal during Salazar's dictatorship', etc.

:''Santiago es la capital de Chile.'' (Spanish)
:''Santiago é a capital d'''o''' Chile.'' (Portuguese)
:'Santiago is the capital of  Chile.'

:''Él es de Costa Rica, que está en América Central.'' (Spanish)
:''Ele é d'''a''' Costa Rica, que fica n'''a''' América Central.'' (Portuguese)
:'He is from Costa Rica, which is in Central America.'

:''Tengo un boleto para ('''los''') Estados Unidos de América.'' (Spanish)
:''Tenho um bilhete para '''os''' Estados Unidos d'''a''' América.'' (Portuguese)
:'I have a ticket to '''the''' United States of America.'

:''Nueva Delhi no es la ciudad más poblada de ('''la''') India''. (Spanish)
:''Nova Déli não é a cidade mais populosa d'''a''' Índia''. (Portuguese)
:'New Delhi is not the most populous city in India.'

:'''''La''' Europa medieval pertenecía a monarcas absolutos''. (Spanish)
:'''''A''' Europa medieval pertencia a monarcas absolutos''. (Portuguese)
:'Medieval Europe belonged to absolute monarchs.'

Portuguese omits the definite article in stating the time of day unless ''para as'' is used.

:''Son '''las''' nueve y quince'', but also ''Son nueve y quince'' or ''Son nueve quince''. (Spanish)
<span>fhhfkjhkldhkjvhlfghvkhksdhkjvhfkgj</span>
:''São nove e quinze''. (Portuguese)
:'It's nine fifteen.'

In addition, in most dialects of Portuguese the definite article is used before [[possessive adjective]]s (like in [[Italian language|Italian]]), which is not possible in Spanish. For instance, the sentence 'This is my brother' is ''Este es mi hermano'' in Spanish, but may be ''Este é '''o''' meu irmão'' in Portuguese. Nevertheless, in many Brazilian dialects (mostly in the Northeast) and in casual BP the article is not used in sentences such as: ''Este é meu irmão'' (although it usually appears in sentences such as ''O meu irmão está lá'').

===Possessives===
In Portuguese, [[possessive adjective]]s have the same form as [[possessive pronoun]]s, and they all agree with the gender of the possessed item. In Spanish, the same is true of ''nuestro''/''nuestra'' ("our") and ''vuestro''/''vuestra'' ("your" [plural]), but for all other possessives, the pronoun has a longer form that agrees with the gender of the possessed item, while the adjective has a shorter form that does not change for gender. The possessive adjectives are normally preceded by a definite article in Continental Portuguese, less so in Brazilian Portuguese, and never in Spanish. The possessive pronouns are preceded by a definite article in all dialects of both languages. See examples in the table below.

===Pronouns===

====Object pronouns====
In Portuguese, third-person [[clitic]] pronouns have special variants used after certain types of verb endings, which does not happen in Spanish. The default object pronouns ''o''/''a''/''os''/''as'' change to ''lo''/''la''/''los''/''las'' when they follow a verb that ends in ⟨r⟩, ⟨s⟩ or ⟨z⟩, and to ''no''/''na''/''nos''/''nas'' when they follow a verb that ends in a nasal sound.

|-
|align=left| '''''lo''' mantienen'' ||align=left| ''mantêm-'''no'''''  ||align=left| 'they keep it'
|}

In Brazilian Portuguese, these forms are uncommon, since the pronoun normally precedes the verb (i.e., ''você '''o''' mantenha'' in the above example), and third-person subject pronouns are used informally as object pronouns (''mantenha '''ele'''''), though the latter is technically incorrect. However, as it has been considered ungrammatical to begin a sentence with an object pronoun, the above examples are, on rare occasion, used in Brazil as well.

====Clitic personal pronouns====
European Portuguese differs from Brazilian Portuguese with regard to the placement of [[clitic]] personal pronouns, and Spanish is in turn different from both of them.

*In Spanish, clitic pronouns normally come before the verb, except with the imperative, the infinitive, and the gerund. In verbal periphrases, they precede the [[auxiliary verb]].
*In spoken Brazilian Portuguese, clitic pronouns normally come before the ''main'' verb. In verbal periphrases, they come between the auxiliary verb and the main verb. This occurs even with the imperative, the infinitive, the gerund, and the past participle.
*In European Portuguese, clitic pronouns may come before or after the verb, depending on the type of [[clause]]. In verbal periphrases, they may precede or follow the auxiliary verb, or follow the main verb (when this is in the infinitive or the gerund).

|}

====Mesoclisis====
In Portuguese, verbs in the future indicative or conditional tense may be split into [[morpheme]]s, and the clitic pronoun can be inserted between them, a feature known as [[mesoclisis]]. This also occurred in [[Old Spanish]], but no comparable phenomenon takes place in modern Spanish:

:'''''Lo''' traerá.'' (Spanish)
:''Trá-'''lo'''-á.'' (European Portuguese and very formal written Brazilian Portuguese)
:'He/She will bring '''it'''.'

However, these tenses are often replaced with others in the spoken language. Future indicative is sometimes replaced by present indicative; conditional is very often replaced by imperfect indicative. In colloquial language, most Portuguese would state ''trá-lo-á'' as ''vai trazê-lo'' ('going to bring it') or ''irá trazê-lo'' ('will bring it').

====Combining pronouns in Spanish====
The Spanish construction, ''se lo dio'', means either '[He/She] gave it to [him/her]' or '[He/She] gave it to ''himself/herself'''. The expected pattern for the former would be *'''''le''' lo dio'', but such a construction does not exist. This is unique to Spanish.

*Latin: {{sm|dedit illis illvd}} → {{sm|dedit illis illvm}} (early [[Vulgar Latin]]) → {{sm|dit illis illu}} (Late Vulgar Latin)
*Spanish: ''dio (i)lli (el)lo'' → ''dio ge lo'' → ''diógelo'' (arch.) → ''dióselo'' → ''se lo dio''
*Portuguese: ''deu (i)lli (l)o'' → ''deu lhe (l)o'' → ''deu-lho''

Thus, modern Spanish makes no distinction between the [[reflexive pronoun]] ''se'' and the [[dative case|dative]] personal pronoun ''se''. Note that this did not happen in old Spanish: ''dió'''g'''elo'', 'he gave it to him', ''dió'''s'''elo'', 'he gave it to himself'. The medieval ''g'' sound (similar to that of French) was replaced with ''s'' in the 14th-15th centuries (cf. Spanish ''co'''g'''er'', 'to catch', but ''co'''s'''echa'', 'harvest', Port. ''colher'' and ''colheita'', both from Lat. {{sm|colligere}}).

====Use of stressed pronouns for inanimate subjects====
In Spanish, stressed pronouns are never used for inanimate subjects (i.e., things, as opposed to people or animals), not even for clarity or disambiguation purposes.<ref>http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=pronombres%20personales%20tónicos</ref>  Portuguese knows no such restriction, so that stressed pronouns referring to inanimate subjects can either be used or dropped:

:''¿Dónde están las llaves? Están en la mesa.'' (Spanish – pronoun is always dropped)
:''Onde estão as chaves? ('''Elas''') estão na mesa.'' (Portuguese – pronoun is optional)
:'Where are the keys? '''They''' are on the table.' (English – pronoun is required)

====Second-person pronouns====
The use of second-person pronouns differs dramatically between Spanish and Portuguese, and even more so between European and Brazilian Portuguese.  Spanish ''tú'' and ''usted'' correspond etymologically to Portuguese ''tu'' and ''você'', but Portuguese has gained a third, even more formal form ''o(s) senhor(es), a(s) senhora(s)'', demoting ''você'' to an "equalizing" rather than respectful register.  The old familiar forms have been largely lost in the Portuguese-speaking world, as the Portuguese equalizing forms ''você'' or ''vocês'' have displaced ''tu'' to a large extent and ''vós'' almost entirely; and even where ''tu'' is still used, the second-person verb forms that historically corresponded to it are often replaced by the same (third-person) forms that are used with "você".

In the plural, Portuguese familiar ''vós'' is archaic nearly everywhere (as with the old English second singular "thou"), and both the pronoun and its corresponding second-person plural verb forms are generally limited to the Bible, traditional prayers, and spoken varieties of certain regions of rural Portugal; normally, the familiar (and equalizing) form is now ''vocês''. In the case of Peninsular Spanish, ''tú'', ''usted'', ''vosotros'', and ''ustedes'' have more or less kept their original functions; if anything, ''tú'' is displacing ''usted'' out of common use and ''usted'' is coming to be used only for formal situations (like ''o senhor'' in Portuguese). Latin American Spanish is more complicated: ''vosotros'' has fallen out of use in favor of ''ustedes'', but certain regions of Spanish America also use ''vos'' as a ''singular'' informal pronoun, displacing ''tú'' out of its original role to a greater or lesser extent (see ''[[voseo]]'').

Spoken Brazilian Portuguese has dramatically simplified the pronoun system, with ''você(s)'' tending to displace all other forms.  Although a few parts of Brazil still use ''tu'' and the corresponding second-person singular verb forms, most areas either use ''tu'' with third-person verb forms or (increasingly) drop ''tu'' entirely in favor of ''você''.  This has in turn caused the original third-person possessive ''seu, sua'' to shift to primarily second-person use, alongside the appearance of a new third-person possessive ''dele, dela'' (plural ''deles, delas'', "their") that follows the noun (thus paraphrases such as ''o carro dele'' "his car", ''o carro dela'' "her car").  The formal ''o senhor'' is also increasingly restricted to highly formal situations, such as that of a storekeeper addressing a customer, or a child or teenager addressing an adult stranger.

More conservative in this regard is the ''fluminense'' dialect of Brazilian Portuguese (spoken in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Espírito Santo]] and in the [[Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais)|Zona da Mata]] of the state of [[Minas Gerais]]) – especially its ''[[carioca]]'' sociolect. This dialect generally preserves intimate or familiar ''tu'', the standard equalizing form ''você'', and the respectful or formal ''o senhor''/''a senhora'', together with their related possessives, to such an extent that almost all speakers use these forms, according to context. Nevertheless, a minority of educated speakers correctly conjugates all of the ''tu'' pronouns formally; otherwise, it is mostly conjugated as ''você''.

Standard Portuguese usage has ''vocês'' and ''os senhores/as senhoras'' as plurals of ''você'' and ''o senhor''/''a senhora'', but the vernacular has also produced new forms with the second-person familiar plural function, such as ''gente'' (compare '''''a''' gente'' as a possible colloquial variation of ''nós'', "we"/"us", that should, but commonly is not, be conjucated as third-person singular), ''pessoas'', ''pessoal'', ''[meu] povo'', ''cês'' ([[eye dialect]] for ''vocês'' in colloquial pronunciation), and ''galera'' (the latter mainly associated with youth slang).

It is often said that the ''gaúcho'', ''nordestino'' and ''amazofonia'' dialects, as well as some sociolects elsewhere, such as that in and around the city of [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]], have preserved ''tu''; but unlike in ''fluminense'', the use of ''você'' is very limited, and entirely absent among some speakers, and ''tu'' takes its place. In these areas, the verb with ''tu'' is conjugated in the third-person form (as with ''você'') – except among educated speakers in some urban centers such as [[Porto Alegre]] and, especially, [[Belém]]. See [[Brazilian Portuguese]].

===Verbs===

===="To be"====
Spanish and Portuguese have two main [[copula (linguistics)|copula]]s, ''ser'' and ''estar''. For the most part, the use of these verbs is the same in both languages, but there are a few cases where it differs. The main difference between Spanish and Portuguese is in the interpretation of the concept of state versus essence and in the generalisations one way or another that are made in certain constructions.  For instance,

:'''''Está''' prohibido fumar.'' (Spanish) [estar]
:'''''É''' proibido fumar.'' (Portuguese) [ser]
:'Smoking '''is''' forbidden.'

:''La silla '''está''' hecha de madera.'' (Spanish) [estar]
:''A cadeira '''é''' feita de madeira.'' (Portuguese) [ser]
:'The chair '''is''' made of wood.'

:''Sólo uno '''es''' correcto.'' (Spanish) [ser]
:''Só um '''está''' correto''. (Portuguese) [estar]
:'Only one '''is''' correct.'

Also, the use of ''ser'' regarding a permanent location is much more accepted in Portuguese.  Conversely, ''estar'' is often permanent in Spanish regarding a location, while in Portuguese, it implies being temporary and/or something within the immediate vicinity (same house, building, etc.)
  
:''Nuestra oficina '''queda''''' (or '''''está''''') ''muy lejos.'' (Spanish) [quedar/estar]
:''O nosso escritório '''é''''' (or '''''fica''''') ''muito longe.'' (Portuguese) [ser/ficar]
: 'Our office '''is''' very far away.'

:''¿Dónde '''está''''' (or  '''''queda''''') ''el aeropuerto?'' (Spanish) [estar/quedar]
:''Onde '''fica''''' (or '''''é''''') ''o aeroporto?'' (Portuguese) [ficar/ser]
:'Where '''is''' the airport?'

Because the airport is obviously not anywhere nearby, ''ficar'' is used in Portuguese (most common), though ''ser'' can also be used.

Secondary copulas are ''quedar(se)'' in Spanish and ''ficar'' in Portuguese.  Each can also mean 'to stay' or 'to remain.'

: '''''Me quedé''' dentro de la casa todo el día.'' (Spanish)
: '''''Fiquei''' dentro de casa todo o dia.'' (Portuguese)
: ''''I stayed''' inside the house all day.'

The Spanish sentence using the reflexive form of the verb (''quedarse'') implies that staying inside the house was voluntary, while Portuguese and English are quite ambiguous on this matter without any additional context. (See also the next section.)

Both Spanish ''quedar(se)'' and Portuguese ''ficar'' can mean 'become':

:''Mi abuela '''se está quedando''' sorda.'' (Spanish)
:''A minha avó '''está ficando''' surda.''  (Brazilian Portuguese and some dialects of European Portuguese)
:''A minha avó '''está a ficar''' surda.''  (European Portuguese)
:'My grandmother '''is becoming''' deaf.'

====Reflexive verbs====
[[Reflexive verb]]s are somewhat more frequent in Spanish than in Portuguese, especially with actions relating to parts of the body:

:''Guillermo '''se''' quebró la pierna jugando a la pelota.'' (Spanish)
:''O Guilherme quebrou a perna jogando bola.'' (Brazilian Portuguese)
:''O Guilherme partiu a perna a jogar à bola.'' (European Portuguese)
:'William broke his leg playing football.'

===="To like"====
The Portuguese and Spanish verbs for expressing "liking" are similar in form (''gostar'' and ''gustar'' respectively) but different in their arrangement of [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]]. Arguments in linguistics are expressions that enable a verb to complete its meaning. Expressions of liking typically require two arguments: (1) a person who likes something (sometimes called the [[Theta role|"experiencer"]]), and (2) something that the person likes (sometimes called the [[Theta role|"theme"]]). Portuguese and Spanish (as well as English) assign different [[grammatical cases]] to these arguments, as shown in the following table:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:800px; height:100px;"
|+ Argument structure with verbs of liking
|-
! 
! Person who likes
! Thing that is liked
! Form
|-
! Portuguese
| Subject || Object of preposition ''de'' || (Eu) gosto de ouvir música.
|-
! Spanish
| Indirect object || Subject || Me gusta escuchar música.
|-
! English
| Subject || Direct object || I like to listen to music.
|}

The Portuguese sentence can be translated literally as "[I] [take satisfaction] [from] [listening to music]", while the Spanish corresponds to "[To me] [(it) is pleasing] [to listen to music]."

It is also possible in Spanish to express it as: "(Yo) gusto de escuchar música", although this use has become antiquated.

====Auxiliary verb of the perfect====
In Spanish, the compound [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] is constructed with the [[auxiliary verb]] ''haber'' (< Latin {{sm|habere}}). Although Portuguese used to use its cognate verb (''haver'') in this way, now it's more common to form these tenses with ''ter'' ('to have') (<  Latin {{sm|tenere}}). ''Haver'' is more used in Brazilian Portuguese, while ''ter'' is used as an auxiliary by other Iberian languages; it is much more pervasive in Portuguese. Note that most Portuguese verb tables only contain ''ter'' with regard to the perfect.

:'' Yo ya '''había''' comido cuando mi madre volvió.'' (Spanish) [imperfect form of ''haber'']
:'' Eu já comera quando a minha mãe voltou.'' (Portuguese) [pluperfect inherited from [[Latin]]]
:'' Eu já '''tinha''' comido quando a minha mãe voltou.'' (Portuguese) [imperfect form of ''ter'']
:'' Eu já '''havia''' comido quando a minha mãe voltou.'' (Portuguese) [imperfect form of ''haver'']
:'I '''had''' already eaten when my mother returned.'

====Imperfect subjunctive versus pluperfect indicative====
A class of [[false friend]]s between the two languages is composed of the verb forms with endings containing -''ra''-, such as ''cantara'', ''cantaras'', ''cantáramos'', and so on. Spanish has two forms for the imperfect [[subjunctive]], one with endings in ''-se-'' and another with endings in -''ra''- (e.g., ''cantase''/''cantara'' 'were I to sing'), which are usually interchangeable. In Portuguese, only ''cantasse'' has this value; ''cantara'' is employed as a [[pluperfect]] indicative, i.e., the equivalent to Spanish ''había cantado'' ('I had sung'). Although there is a strong tendency to use a verb phrase instead in the spoken language, like in Spanish and English (''tinha cantado''), the simple tense is still frequent in literature.

====Present perfect====
In Spanish, as in English, the [[present perfect]] is normally used to talk about an action initiated and completed in the past, which is still considered relevant or influential in the present moment. In Portuguese, the same meaning is conveyed by the simple [[preterite]], as in the examples below:

:''No, gracias. Ya '''he cenado'''.'' (Spanish) [present perfect]
:''Não, obrigado. Já '''jantei'''.'' (Portuguese) [preterite]
:'No, thank you. '''I have''' already '''dined'''.' [present perfect]

:'''''He ido''' a España dos veces.'' (Spanish) [present perfect]
:'''''Fui''' à Espanha duas vezes.'' (Portuguese) [preterite]
:''''I have been''' to Spain twice.' [present perfect]

:''¿'''Ha oído''' usted las últimas noticias, señor?'' (Spanish) [present perfect]
:''O senhor '''ouviu''' as últimas notícias?'' (Portuguese) [preterite]
:''''Have you heard''' the latest news, sir?' [present perfect]

Portuguese normally uses the present perfect (''pretérito perfeito composto'') for speaking of an event that began in the past, was repeated regularly up to the present, and could keep happening in the future.  See the contrast with Spanish in the following example:

:'''''He pensado''' en pedirle matrimonio.'' (Spanish) [present perfect]
:''''I have thought''' of asking her/him [indirect object] to marry me [the thought has occurred to me at least once].' [present perfect]
:'''''Tenho pensado''' em pedi-la em casamento.'' (Portuguese) [present perfect]
:''''I have been thinking''' of asking her [direct object] to marry me.' [present perfect continuous]

As this example suggests, the Portuguese present perfect is often closer in meaning to the English present perfect ''continuous''. See also [[Spanish verbs#Contrasting the preterite and the perfect|Spanish verbs: Contrasting the preterite and the perfect]].

====Personal infinitive====
Portuguese, uniquely among the major Romance languages, has acquired a [[Portuguese verb conjugation|"personal infinitive"]], which can be used as an alternative to a subordinate clause with a finite verb in the subjunctive. 
:''A recepcionista pediu para '''esperarmos'''.'' (Portuguese) [personal infinitive]
:''A recepcionista pediu que '''esperássemos'''.'' (Portuguese) [imperfect subjunctive]
:''La recepcionista nos pidió que '''esperáramos'''/'''esperásemos'''.'' (Spanish) [imperfect subjunctive]
:'The receptionist asked for '''us to wait'''.' (literal personal infinitive translation)
:'The receptionist asked that '''we wait'''.'  (literal Portuguese imperfect subjunctive translation)

The Portuguese perfect form of the personal infinitive corresponds to one of several possible Spanish finite verbs.
:''Alguém nos acusou de '''termos roubado''' uma caneta.'' (Portuguese)
:''Alguien nos acusó de haber robado un bolígrafo.'' (Spanish)
:'Somebody accused us of having stolen a pen.'

On some occasions, the personal infinitive can hardly be replaced by a finite clause and corresponds to a different structure in Spanish (and English):
:''O hábito de '''fumares''' à janela é desagradável.'' (Portuguese, using personal infinitive. Literally, 'The habit of '''[you] smoking''' at the window is unpleasant.')
:''(O) teu hábito de '''fumar''' à janela é desagradável.'' (Portuguese, using '''im'''personal infinitive. Literally, '(The) Your habit of '''smoking''' at the window is unpleasant.')
:''Tu hábito de '''fumar''' junto a una ventana es desagradable.'' (Spanish: 'Your habit of smoking close to a window is unpleasant.')

The personal infinitive is ''not'' used in counterfactual situations, as these require either the future subjunctive or the imperfect subjunctive. 'If we were/had been rich...' is ''Se fôssemos ricos...'', not ''*Se sermos ricos...'' Also, it is conjugated the same as the future subjunctive (see next section), provided the latter is not irregular (''ser'', ''estar'', ''ter'', etc.)  The personal infinitive is ''never'' irregular, though the circumflex accent may be dropped in writing on expanded forms (such as ''pôr'').<ref>[http://tools.verbix.com/webverbix/Portuguese.html?verb=p%C3%B4r&D1=2&H1=102&imageField.x=12&imageField.y=1 Verbix Conjugation]</ref>

In the first and third person singular, the personal infinitive appears no different from the unconjugated infinitive.

:''É bom eu/ele '''esperar''' um bocadinho.'' (Portuguese)
:'It is good that I/he wait(s) a bit.'

The above rules also apply whenever the subjects of the two clauses are the same, but independent of each other.
:''Para '''chegarmos''' cedo, temos/teremos que nos apressar.'' (Portuguese) [personal infinitive]
:''Para que '''lleguemos''' temprano, necesitamos apresurarnos.'' (Spanish) [present subjunctive]
:'For '''us to arrive''' early, we <u> will </u> need to hurry.'

:''Para '''chegarmos''' cedo, tínhamos/teríamos que nos apressar.'' (Portuguese) [personal infinitive]
:''Para que '''llegáramos'''/'''llegásemos''' temprano, necesitaríamos apresurarnos.'' (Spanish) [imperfect subjunctive]
:'For '''us to arrive''' early, we <u> would </u> need to hurry.'

As shown, the personal infinitive can be used at times to replace both the impersonal infinitive and the subjunctive. Spanish has no such alternative.

====Future subjunctive====
The future subjunctive, now virtually obsolete in Spanish, continues in use in both written and spoken Portuguese.  It is used in [[Dependent clause|subordinate clauses]] referring to a hypothetical future event or state – either [[adverbial clause]]s (usually introduced by ''se'' 'if ' or ''quando'' 'when') or [[Relative clause|adjective clauses]] that modify nouns referring to a hypothetical future entity.  Spanish, in the analogous if-clauses, uses the present indicative, and in the ''cuando-'' and adjective clauses uses the present subjunctive.

:''Se eu '''for''''' ''eleito presidente, mudarei a lei.'' (Portuguese)
:''Si yo '''soy''''' ''elegido presidente, cambiaré la ley.'' (Spanish)
:'If I '''am''' elected president, I will change the law.'

:''Quando '''fores''''' ''mais velho, compreenderás.'' (Portuguese)
:''Cuando '''seas''''' ''mayor, comprenderás.'' (Spanish)
:'When you '''are''' older, you'll understand.'

:''Dar-se-á/Se dará o prêmio à primeira pessoa que '''disser''' a resposta correta.'' (Portuguese)
:''Se dará el premio a la primera persona que '''diga''' la respuesta correcta.'' (Spanish)
:'The prize will be given to the first person who '''says''' the right answer.'

====Irregular verbs====
A number of irregular verbs in Portuguese change the main vowel to indicate differences between first and third person singular: ''fiz'' 'I did' vs ''fez'' 'he did', ''pude'' 'I could' vs ''pôde'' 'he could', ''fui'' 'I was' vs ''foi'' 'he was', ''tive'' 'I had' vs ''teve'' 'he had', etc.  These vowel differences stem from vowel raising ([[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]]) triggered historically by the final {{sm|-'''ī'''}} of the first-person singular in Latin.  Spanish maintains such a difference only in ''fui'' 'I was' vs ''fue'' 'he was'. In all other cases, one of the two vowels has been regularized throughout the conjugation and a new third-person ending ''-o'' adopted: ''hice'' 'I did' vs ''hizo'' 'he did', ''pude'' 'I could' vs ''pudo'' 'he could', etc.

Contrarily, Spanish maintains many more irregular forms in the future and conditional: ''saldré'' 'I will leave', ''pondré'' 'I will put', ''vendré'' 'I will come', ''diré'' 'I will say', etc.  Portuguese has only three: ''farei'' 'I will do', ''direi'' 'I will say', ''trarei'' 'I will carry'.

Portuguese drops -''e'' in "irregular" third-person singular present indicative forms after ⟨z⟩ and ⟨r⟩, according to phonological rules: ''faz'' 'he does', ''diz'' 'he says', ''quer'' 'he wants', etc.  Spanish has restored -''e'' by analogy with other verbs: ''hace'' 'he does', ''dice'' 'he says', ''quiere'' 'he wants', etc. (The same type of analogy accounts for ''fiz'' vs ''hice'' 'I did' in the past tense.  In nouns such as ''paz'' 'peace', ''luz'' 'light', ''amor'' 'love', etc. ''-e'' was dropped in both languages and never restored).

===Prepositions===

====Contractions====
In Spanish the prepositions ''a'' ('to') and ''de'' ('of, from') form [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] with a following masculine singular definite article (''el'' 'the'):  ''a'' + ''el'' > ''al'', and ''de'' + ''el'' > ''del''.  This kind of contraction is much more extensive in Portuguese, involving the prepositions ''a'' ('to'), ''de'' ('of, from'), ''em'' ('in'), and ''por'' ('for') with [[article (grammar)|articles]] and [[demonstratives]] regardless of number or gender.<ref>See a list at [[:pt:Anexo:Lista de contrações na língua portuguesa|Wikipedia in Portuguese: List of contracted prepositions]]</ref>  All four of these prepositions join with the definite article, as shown in the following table:

{|class="wikitable"
! Preposition +<br>definite article<br>(Portuguese)
! ''a''
! ''de''
! ''em''
! ''por''
|-
|  style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''o''<br>(masc.sing.) ||align=center| ''ao'' ||align=center| ''do'' || ''no'' <sup>1</sup> || ''pelo''
|- 
|  style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''a''<br>(fem.sing.) ||align=center| ''à'' <sup>2</sup> ||align=center| ''da'' || ''na'' || ''pela''
|-
|  style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''os''<br>(masc.pl.) ||align=center| ''aos'' ||align=center| ''dos'' <sup>1</sup> || ''nos'' || ''pelos'' 
|-
|  style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''as''<br>(fem.pl.) ||align=center| ''às'' ||align=center| ''das'' || ''nas'' ||''pelas'' 
|}
<small><sup>1</sup>These Portuguese contractions include some potential "[[false friends]]" for the reader of Spanish, such as ''no'' (Port. 'in the', Sp. 'no, not') and ''dos'' (Port. 'of the', Sp. 'two').</small><br>
<small><sup>2</sup>In European Portuguese, ''a'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ɐ]}}, while ''à'' is pronounced {{IPA|[a]}}. Both are generally {{IPA|[a]}} in most of Brazil, although in some accents such as ''carioca'' and ''florianopolitano'' there may be distinction.</small>

Additionally, the prepositions ''de'' and ''em'' combine with the demonstrative adjectives and pronouns as shown below:
{|class="wikitable"
! Preposition +<br>demonstrative<br>(Portuguese)
! ''de''
! ''em''
|-
|  style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''este'' (masc.sing.)<br>''esta'' (fem.sing.)<br>''estes'' (masc.pl.)<br>''estas'' (fem.pl.) ||align=center| ''deste''<br>''desta''<br>''destes''<br>''destas'' ||align=center| ''neste''<br>''nesta''<br>''nestes''<br>''nestas'' 
|- 
|  style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''esse'' (masc.sing.)<br>''essa'' (fem.sing.)<br>''esses'' (masc.pl.)<br>''essas'' (fem.pl.) ||align=center| ''desse''<br>''dessa''<br>''desses''<br>''dessas'' ||align=center| ''nesse''<br>''nessa''<br>''nesses''<br>''nessas''
|-
|  style="text-align:center; background:#dbdbdb;"| ''aquele'' (masc.sing.)<br>''aquela'' (fem.sing.)<br>''aqueles'' (masc.pl.)<br>''aquelas'' (fem.pl.) ||align=center| ''daquele''<br>''daquela''<br>''daqueles''<br>''daquelas'' ||align=center| ''naquele''<br>''naquela''<br>''naqueles''<br>''naquelas''
|}

The neuter demonstrative pronouns (''isto'' 'this' ''isso'', ''aquilo'' 'that') likewise combine with ''de'' and ''em'' – thus, ''disto'', ''nisto'', etc.  And the preposition ''a'' combines with the "distal" demonstratives (those that begin with ''a-'') to form ''àquele'', ''àquilo'', etc.

The Portuguese contractions mentioned thus far are obligatory.  Contractions also can be optionally formed from ''em'' and ''de'' with the indefinite article (''um'', ''uma'', ''uns'', ''umas''), resulting in ''num'', ''numa'', ''dum'', ''duma'', etc. and from the third person pronouns (''ele'', ''ela'', ''eles'', ''elas''), resulting in ''nele'', ''nela'', ''dele'', ''dela'', etc.  Other optional contractions include ''de'' with ''aqui'' >  ''daqui'' ('from here') and even with the noun ''água'' (''um copo d'água'' 'a glass of water').

The Spanish ''con'' ('with', ''com'' in Portuguese) combines with the prepositional pronouns ''mí'', ''ti'', and ''sí'' to form ''conmigo'', ''contigo'', ''consigo'' ('with me', 'with you', 'with him-/herself ').  In Portuguese this process not only applies to the pronouns ''mim'', ''ti'', and ''si'' (giving ''comigo'', ''contigo'', and ''consigo''), but also is extended to ''nós'' and (in those varieties that use it) ''vós'', producing ''connosco'' (''conosco'' in Brazilian Portuguese) and ''convosco''.

====Personal "''a''"====
Spanish employs a preposition, the so-called "personal ''a''", before the [[direct object]] of a [[transitive verb]] (except ''tener'') when it denotes a specific person(s), or domestic [[pet]]; thus ''Veo '''a''' Juan'' 'I see John'; ''Hemos invitado '''a''' los estudiantes'' 'We've invited the students.'
In Portuguese, personal ''a'' is virtually non-existent, except before ''Deus'' 'God':  ''louvar '''a''' Deus'' 'to praise God', ''amar '''a''' Deus'' 'to love God'.

====''Ir a'' versus ''ir para''====
Quite common in both languages are the prepositions ''a'' (which often translates as "to"), and ''para'' (which often translates as "for").  However, European Portuguese distinguishes between going somewhere for a short while versus a longer stay, especially if it is an intended destination, in the latter case using ''para'' instead of ''a''.  While there is no  specified duration of stay before a European Portuguese speaker must switch prepositions, ''a'' implies one will return sooner, rather than later, relative to the context. This distinction is not made in English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese, and the Spanish ''para'' cannot be used for this purpose.
 
:''Fui '''a'''l mercado cerca de mi casa.'' (Spanish)
:''Fui '''a'''o mercado perto de/da minha casa.''/''Fui '''para ''' o mercado perto de/da minha casa.'' (European and Brazilian Portuguese)
:'I went '''to''' the market near my house.' [temporary displacement]

:''El presidente anterior fue exiliado '''a''' Portugal.'' (Spanish)
:''O presidente anterior foi exilado '''para''' Portugal.'' (European and Brazilian Portuguese)
:'The former president was exiled '''to''' Portugal.' [permanent, or more lasting displacement]

Note, though, in the first example, ''para'' could be used in Portuguese if in contrast to a very brief period of time.

:''Não fico muito tempo, só um minuto. Tenho que/de ir '''para''' o mercado.'' (Portuguese)
:'I can't stay long, only a minute. I have to go '''to''' the market.' [pending task or appointment]

In informal, non-standard Brazilian Portuguese, ''em'' (in its original form or combined with a given article in a contraction, yielding ''no'', ''na'', ''numa'', etc.), often replaces the preposition ''a'' from standard Portuguese.

:''Vou '''na''' padaria.'' (non-standard Brazilian Portuguese)
:''Vou '''à''' padaria.'' (standard Portuguese)
:'I'm going '''to the''' bakery.'

:''Fui '''numa''' festa ontem.'' (non-standard Brazilian Portuguese)
:''Fui '''a uma''' festa ontem.'' (standard Portuguese)
:'I went '''to a''' party yesterday.'

Such a construction is not used in Spanish or in European Portuguese.

In Portuguese the preposition '''até''' can also be used when the duration of the stay is expected to be short or when there is a specific reason for going somewhere.

:''Vou '''até''' a praia.''
:'I'm going to the beach.'

====''Hacia'' and ''para''====
Spanish has two prepositions of direction: ''para'' ('for', including 'headed for [a destination]'), and ''hacia'' ('toward [not necessarily implying arrival]'). Of them, only ''para'' exists in Portuguese, covering both meanings.

:''Este regalo es '''para''' ti''. (Spanish)
:''Este presente é '''para''' ti''. (Portuguese)
:'This gift is '''for''' you.'

:''Aquel/Ese avión va '''hacia''' Brasilia.'' (Spanish)
:''Aquele avião voa '''para''' Brasília.'' (Portuguese)
:'That airplane is flying '''toward''' Brasília.'

Colloquially, ''para'' is often reduced in both languages:  to ''pa''' in Spanish,<ref>Jacques De Bruyne, ''A Comprehensive Spanish Grammar'' (Oxford:  Blackwell, 1995), §752.</ref> and to ''pra'' (sometimes written ''p'ra'' and this form may be used in literature) or ''pa'' (only in slang in Portugal and Rio de Janeiro, and not permitted in writing) in Portuguese. Portuguese ''pra'', in turn, may join with the definite article:  ''pra'' + ''o'' > ''pro'' (BP) or ''prò'' (EP), ''pra'' + ''a'' > ''pra'' (BP) or ''prà'' (EP), etc.<ref>[[Novo Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa|Aurélio]] defines the words ''pra¹'' as a syncopated form of ''para'', and ''pra²'' and ''pro'' as a contraction of ''pra¹'' plus the article.</ref> In reference to the slang option ''pa'', these become: ''pa'' + ''o'' > ''pò'', ''pa'' + ''a'' > ''pà'', etc.

===="Going to" future====
Both languages have a construction similar to the [[Going-to future|English "going-to" future]]. Spanish includes the preposition ''a'' between the conjugated form of ''ir'' "to go" and the infinitive: ''Vamos '''a''' cantar'' 'We're going to sing' (present tense of ''ir'' + ''a'' + infinitive). Usually, in Portuguese, there is no preposition between the helping verb and the main verb: ''Vamos cantar'' (present tense of ''ir'' + infinitive).  This also applies when the verb is in other tenses:

: ''Ayer yo iba '''a''' leer el libro, pero no tuve la oportunidad.'' (Spanish)
: ''Ontem eu ia ler o livro, mas não tive oportunidade.'' (Portuguese)
: Yesterday I was going '''to''' read the book, but never had the chance.

====Other differences in preposition usage====
While as a rule the same prepositions are used in the same contexts in both languages, there are many exceptions.

:''Nuestros gastos '''de''' energía.'' (Spanish)
:''(Os) nossos gastos '''com'''/'''de''' energia.'' (Portuguese)
:Our energy expenses.

:''Voy '''a''' votar '''por''' Juan.'' (Spanish)
:''Vou votar '''em'''/'''no''' João.'' (Portuguese)
:I'm going to vote '''for''' John.

==Orthography==

===Alphabet===
The traditional [[Spanish alphabet]] had 28 letters, while the [[Portuguese alphabet|Portuguese]] had 23. Modern versions of recent years added ''k'' and ''w'' (found only in foreign words) to both languages. Portuguese also added ''y'' for loanwords.

With the reform in 1994 by the 10th congress of the Association of Spanish Language Academies, Spanish alphabetization now follows the same pattern as that of other major West European languages.  Prior to this date, however, digraphs were independently alphabetized.  For example, the following [[surnames]] would be put in this order: ''Cervantes, Contreras, Cruz, '''Ch'''ávez, Dávila''.  Many Spanish dictionaries and other reference material still exist using the pre-reform rule of alphabetization.

:'''Current Spanish alphabet''' ([[Spanish alphabet|Spanish alphabet reform of 1994]])

</big>

In Spanish, ⟨gu⟩, ⟨qu⟩, and ⟨sc⟩ in Latin American Spanish are not called digraphs, however they are single sounds as in Portuguese (for the exception of ⟨sc⟩ in European Portuguese). Also Spanish has taken ⟨sh⟩ {{IPA|/ʃ/}} from English as a loan sound; e.g., ''sherpa'', ''show'', ''flash''. Brazilian Portuguese uses the trigraph ⟨tch⟩ {{IPA|/tʃ/}} for loanwords; e.g., ''tchau'', '[[ciao]]', ''tcheco'' 'Czech', ''República Tcheca'' 'Czech Republic', ''tchê'' '[[che (Spanish)|che]]'&nbsp;(this latter is regional), etc. European Portuguese normally replace the trigraph ⟨tch⟩ with ⟨ch⟩ {{IPA|/ʃ/}}: ''chau'', ''checo'', ''República Checa'', etc.

Both Spanish and Portuguese use ⟨zz⟩ {{IPA|/ts/}} (never as {{IPA|/dz/}} – this sequence appears only in loanwords from Japanese, e.g., [[Azuki bean|''adzuki'']]) for some Italian loanwords, but in Portuguese may sometimes not be pronounced as affricate, but having an [[Portuguese phonology#Epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/ɨ/}}; e.g., Sp. and Port. ''pizza'' 'pizza', Sp. and Port. ''paparazzo'' 'paparazzo', etc. Spanish also utilizes ⟨tz⟩ {{IPA|/ts/}} for Basque, Catalan and Nahuatl loanwords, and ⟨tl⟩ {{IPA|/tɬ/}} (or {{IPA|/tl/}}) for Nahuatl loanwords; e.g., ''Ertzaintza'', ''quetzal'', ''xoloitzcuintle'', ''Tlaxcala'', etc. Portuguese utilizes ⟨ts⟩ for [[German language|German]], originarily ⟨z⟩, and Japanese loanwords.

===Question and exclamation marks===

Only in Spanish do interrogatives and exclamations use the question mark or exclamation point respectively at the beginning of a sentence. The same punctuation marks are used, but these are inverted. This prepares the reader in advance for either a question or exclamation type of sentence.

:Interrogative: ''¿Cuántos años tienes?'' (Spanish)
:Exclamation: ''¡Cuidado con el perro!''  (Spanish)

On the other hand, in Portuguese, a person reading aloud lengthy sentences from unfamiliar text may have to scan ahead to check if what at first appears to be a statement, is actually a question. Otherwise, it would be too late to enable proper voice inflection. Neither language has the equivalent of the [[auxiliary verb]] ''to do'', which is often used to begin a question in English. Both Spanish and English can place the verb before the subject noun to indicate a question, though this is uncommon in Portuguese, and almost unheard of in Brazil. In fact, most yes/no questions in Portuguese are written the same as a statement except for the final question mark.

:Spanish: '''''¿Tiene usted''' una medida de cuál es su exposición a estos riesgos, y '''está usted''' confiado de que su organización está minimizando el impacto de los mismos sobre sus accionistas, equipo de trabajo y otros grupos interesados'''?'''''

:Portuguese: ''Você tem a medida de qual é a sua exposição a esses riscos, e tem confiança que sua organização está minimizando os impactos resultantes, em seus acionistas, funcionários e outros interessados'''?'''''

:English: ''''Do you''' have a measure of what your exposure is to these risks, and '''are you''' confident that your organization is minimizing their impact on your shareholders, staff, and other interested parties'''?''''

Aside from changes of punctuation in written language, in speech, converting any of the above examples from a question to a statement would involve changes of both intonation and syntax in English, intonation and probably syntax in Spanish, and intonation only in Portuguese.

===Different spellings for similar sounds===
The [[palatal consonant]]s are spelled differently in the two languages.

| style="background:#dbdbdb;"|palatal "l" || ''ll'' || {{IPA|ʎ}} (~ {{IPA|ʝ}})<ref>The phoneme represented by ⟨ll⟩ has merged with the one represented by ⟨y⟩ in most dialects, commonly realized as {{IPA|[ʝ]}}, or, in [[Rioplatense Spanish|River Plate Spanish]], as {{IPA|[ʒ]}} or as {{IPA|[ʃ]}}.</ref> || ''lh'' || {{IPA|ʎ}}

|}

The symbols ⟨ll⟩ and ⟨ñ⟩ are etymological in Spanish, as the sounds they represent are often derived from Latin {{sm|ll}} and {{sm|nn}} (for those positions, Portuguese has simple ⟨l⟩ and ⟨n⟩; cf. ''rodilla''/''rodela'', ''peña''/''pena''). The Portuguese digraphs ⟨lh⟩ and ⟨nh⟩ were adopted from [[Occitan]], as [[Occitan literature|poetry of the troubadours]] was the most important influence on Portuguese literature up until the 14th century. King [[Denis of Portugal]], who established Portuguese instead of Latin as the official language, was an admirer of the [[Occitan literature|poetry of the troubadours]] and a poet himself. Examples include names such as Port. ''[[Minho River|''Mi'''nh'''o'']]'' (Sp. ''Mi'''ñ'''o'') and ''[[Ferdinand Magellan|''Maga'''lh'''ães'']]'' (Sp. ''Maga'''ll'''anes'').

The letter ⟨y⟩ was used in Portuguese from the 16th to the early 20th century in [[Greek language|Greek]] loans, much as in English (e.g., ''Psychologia'', modern ''Psicologia'' 'Psychology'). The orthographic reform in 1911 officially replaced it with ⟨i⟩. The corresponding sound can be regarded as an [[allophone]] of the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} in both languages. Compare Sp. ''re'''y''''' ('king'), ''ma'''y'''or'' ('greater, elder') with Port. ''re'''i''''' ('king'), ''ma'''i'''or'' ('larger, greater').

The exact pronunciation of these three consonants varies somewhat with dialect. The table indicates only the most common sound values in each language. In most Spanish dialects, the consonants written ⟨ll⟩ and ⟨y⟩ have come to be pronounced the same way, a sound merger known as ''[[yeísmo]]''. A similar phenomenon can be found in some dialects of Brazilian Portuguese (e.g., “''muié''” for ''mulher'', 'woman'), but it is much less widespread than in Spanish.

The Portuguese letter ⟨ç⟩ ([[Ç|c-cedilha]]) was first used in Old Spanish, based on a [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]] form of the letter ⟨z⟩: "[[ꝣ]]". In Portuguese it is used before ⟨a⟩, ⟨o⟩, and ⟨u⟩ (including nasals), and never at the beginning or end of any word. It always represents the "soft ''c''"  sound, namely {{IPAblink|s}}. In modern Spanish, it has been replaced by ⟨z⟩. Example: ''cal'''z'''ado'' (Sp.), ''cal'''ç'''ado'' (Port.) 'footwear'.

===Correspondences between word endings===
Various word endings are consistently different in the two languages.

* Spanish -''n'' corresponds to Portuguese -''m'' when in word-final position (e.g., Spanish: ''jardín'', ''algún''; Portuguese: ''jardim'', ''algum''). In Portuguese, word- or syllable-final ⟨m⟩ and ⟨n⟩ indicate nasalization of the previous vowel; e.g., ''som'' {{IPA|/ˈsõ/}} 'sound' (see [[#Phonology|phonology]] below). In the plural, ⟨m⟩ is replaced with an ⟨n⟩ (Spanish: ''jardines, algunos''; Portuguese: ''jardins, alguns''), that is because in these cases the ⟨m⟩ is not in word-final position anymore. Notice, some rare learned words in Portuguese and Spanish may also have a word final -''n'' (e.g., Portuguese ''abdómen/abdômen'' 'abdomen'), and -''m'' (e.g., Spanish ''tándem'' 'tandem'), respectively.
* Common exceptions to the above rule concern the Spanish noun endings:
** -''án'' and -''ano'', which normally correspond to -''ão'' or -''ã'' in Portuguese (''Irán'' vs ''Irão'' (EP)/''Irã'' (BP) 'Iran', ''hermano'' vs ''irmão'' 'brother', and ''huérfano'' vs ''órfão'', 'orphan [[grammatical gender|m.]]');
**-''ana'', which corresponds to -''ã'' (''hermana'' vs ''irmã'' 'sister', ''mañana'' vs ''manhã'' 'morning', ''huérfana'' vs ''órfã'' 'orphan [[grammatical gender|f.]]');
** -''ón'' / -''ción'' or -''cción'' / -''sión'', which usually correspond to -''ão'' / -''ção'' or -''(c)ção'' / ''-são'' or ''-ssão'' (''melón'' vs ''melão'' 'melon', ''opción'' vs ''opção'' 'option', ''corrección'' vs ''corre(c)ção'' 'correction', ''pensión'' vs ''pensão'' 'pension', or ''admisión'' vs ''admissão'' 'admission');
**-''on'' or -''an'', which corresponds to -''ão'' in most monosyllables (''son'' vs ''são'' 'they are', ''tan'' vs ''tão'' 'as, so');

* The singular noun or adjective endings ''-án'' and ''-ón'' in Spanish both usually correspond to Portuguese ''-ão'', and likewise the Spanish ending ''-ano'' often corresponds to Portuguese ''-ão'' (although there are also many Portuguese words ending in ''-ano'', including [[Demonym|gentilics]] such as ''cubano'', ''boliviano'', etc.). The ''plurals'' of the Portuguese words in ''-ão'', however, generally preserve the historical distinctions: Portuguese -''ãos'', -''ães'', and -''ões'' generally correspond to Spanish ''-anos'', ''-anes'', and ''-ones'', respectively:
** -''ãos'', as in ''mão/mãos'' (Spanish ''mano/manos'', English 'hand(s)');
** -''ães'', as in ''capitão/capitães'' (Spanish ''capitán/capitanes'', English 'captain(s)');
** -''ões'', as in ''melão/melões'' (Spanish ''melón/melones'', English 'melon(s)').

* Notable exceptions to the above rule:
** ''verão/verões'' (Spanish ''verano(s)'' English 'summer(s)');
** ''vulcão/vulcões'' (Spanish ''volcán/volcanes'', English 'volcano');
** ''ancião'', which allows the three plural forms: ''anciãos'', ''anciães'' and ''anciões'' (Spanish ''anciano(s)'', English 'elder(s)').
** ''guardião'', which allows the three plural forms: ''guardiãos'', ''guardiães'' and ''guardiões'' (Spanish ''guardián/guardianes''), English guardian  
** ''vilão'', which allows the three plural forms: ''vilãos'', ''vilães'' and ''vilões'' (Spanish ''villano/villanos''), English villain
** ''João/Joões'' (Spanish ''Juan/Juanes'', English 'John'). This plural can be seen in words such as ''joão-de-barro/joões-de-barro'' (Red Ovenbird).

* The 3rd person plural endings of the [[preterite|preterite indicative tense]] are spelled with -''on'' in Spanish (''pensaron, vivieron'' 'they thought, they lived'), but with -''am'' in Portuguese (''pensaram, viveram'').

*In Portuguese words ending in -''l'' form their plurals by dropping ⟨l⟩ and adding -''is'' (-''eis'' when final unstressed -''il''): ''caracol/caracóis'' (Spanish ''caracol(es)'', English 'snail(s)'), ''fácil/fáceis'' (Spanish ''fácil(es)'', English 'easy').

* In Spanish, adjectives and nouns ending in -''z'' form their plurals by replacing ⟨z⟩ with ⟨c⟩ (-''ces''); e.g., ''feroz''/''feroces'' (Portuguese ''feroz(es)'', English 'ferocious'), ''vez''/''veces'' (Portuguese ''vez(es)'' English 'time(s)').

* Another conspicuous difference is the use of -''z'' in Spanish versus -''s'' in Portuguese at the end of unstressed syllables, especially when the consonant is the last letter in a word. A few examples:

:''Álvarez'', ''Fernández'', ''Suárez'', ''izquierda'', ''mezquino'', ''lápiz'' (Spanish)
:''Álvares'', ''Fernandes'', ''Soares'', ''esquerda'', ''mesquinho'', ''lápis'' (Portuguese)

*Other correspondences between word endings are:<!-- this could be moved to "grammar" -->
**-''dad(es)'' or -''tad(es)'' (Spanish) and -''dade''(s) (Portuguese), as in ''bondad(es)'' vs ''bondade(s)'' 'goodness(es)' and ''libertad(es)'' vs ''liberdade(s)'' 'liberty/ies'. The word ending -''zade(s)'' is also found in Portuguese, e.g., ''amizade(s)'' (Spanish ''amistad(es)'', English 'friendship(s)');
**-''ud(es)'' (Spanish) and -''ude(s)'' (Portuguese), as in ''virtud(es)'' vs ''virtude(s)'' 'virtue';
**-''ble(s)'' (Spanish) and -''vel/eis'' (Portuguese), as in ''amable(s)'' vs ''amável/amáveis'' 'amiable';
**-''je(s)'' (Spanish) and -''gem/ns'' (Portuguese), as in ''lenguaje(s)'' vs ''linguagem/linguagens'' 'language(s)';
**-''aso'' (Spanish) and -''asso'' (Portuguese), as in ''escaso'' vs ''escasso'' 'scarce';
**-''eso'' (Spanish) and -''esso'' (Portuguese), as in ''espeso'' vs ''espesso'' 'thick';
**-''esa'' (Spanish) and -''essa'' or -''esa'' (Portuguese), as in ''condesa'' vs ''condessa'' 'countess' and ''inglesa'' vs ''inglesa'' 'Englishwoman';
**-''eza'' (Spanish) and -''iça'' or -''eza'' (Portuguese), as in ''pereza'' vs ''preguiça'' 'laziness' and ''naturaleza'' vs ''natureza'' 'nature';
**-''ez'' (Spanish) and -''ice'' and -''ez'' (Portuguese), as in ''idiotez'' vs ''idiotice'' 'idiocy' (there are unpredictable exceptions in Portuguese, e.g., ''estupidez'' 'stupidity') and ''timidez'' vs ''timidez'' 'shyness';
**-''izar'' (Spanish) and -''izar'' or -''isar'' (Portuguese), as in ''realizar'' vs ''realizar'' 'to realize/realise' and ''analizar'' vs ''analisar'' 'to analize/analise' (notice there are also some Spanish verbs that in -''isar''; e.g., ''avisar'' 'warn', ''pesquisar'' 'research', etc.) Brazilian Portuguese uses an alternative word ending in -''issar'' in some exceptional cases; e.g., ''aterrissar'', ''alunissar'' (European Portuguese ''aterrar'', ''alunar''; Spanish ''aterrizar'', ''alunizar'', English 'landing', 'moon landing');
**-''azar'' (Spanish) and -''açar'' (Portuguese), ''amenazar'' vs ''ameaçar'' 'threaten';
**-''anza'' (Spanish) and -''ança'' (Portuguese), ''esperanza'' vs ''esperança'' 'hope';
**-''encia'' (Spanish) and -''ença'' or -''ência'' (Portuguese), as in ''diferencia'' vs ''diferença'' 'difference' and ''ocurrencia'' vs ''ocorrência'' 'occurrence' (in Spanish there are few exceptional words ending in -''enza''; e.g., ''vergüenza'' 'shame');
**-''icia'' (Spanish) and -''iça'' or -''ícia'' (Portuguese), as in ''justicia'' vs ''justiça'' 'justice' and ''malicia'' vs ''malícia'' 'malice';
**-''izo'' (Spanish) and -''iço'' (Portuguese), as in ''movedizo'' vs ''movediço'' 'moveable';
**-''miento'' or -''mento'' (Spanish) and -''mento'' (Portuguese), as in ''sentimiento'' vs ''sentimento'' 'feeling, sentiment' and ''reglamento'' vs ''regulamento'' 'rules, regulations';
**-''ísimo'' (Spanish) and -''íssimo'' (Portuguese), as in ''fidelísimo'' vs ''fidelíssimo'' 'most loyal'.

===Accentuation and nasalization===
Both languages use [[diacritic]]s to mark the [[stress (linguistics)|stressed syllable]] of a word whenever it is not otherwise predictable from spelling. Since Spanish does not differentiate between mid-open and mid-close vowels and [[nasal vowels]], it uses only one accent, the [[acute accent|acute]]. Portuguese usually uses the acute accent ( '''´''' ), but also uses the [[circumflex accent]] ( '''ˆ''' ) on the mid-close vowels ⟨ê⟩ and ⟨ô⟩ and the stressed (always nasal in Brasil) ⟨â⟩.

Although the Spanish ⟨y⟩ can be either a consonant or a vowel, as a vowel it never takes an accent.  At the end of a word, the Portuguese [[diphthong]] -''ai'' is the equivalent of the Spanish -''ay'', however, -''ai'' can have an accent on the ⟨í⟩ to [[Hiatus (linguistics)|break the diphthong]] into two separate vowels, e.g., ''açaí'' (three syllables). Without the accent, as in Spanish, the last syllable would be a diphthong: ''Parag<u>uai</u>'' (Portuguese) and ''Parag<u>uay</u>'' (Spanish) 'Paraguay'.

Portuguese nasal vowels occur before ⟨n⟩ and ⟨m⟩ (see [[#Phonology|phonology]] below) without an accent mark, as these consonants are not fully pronounced in such cases.  The [[tilde]] (~), is only used on nasal diphthongs such as ⟨ão⟩ {{IPA|[ɐ̃w̃]}} and ⟨õe⟩ {{IPA|[õj̃]}}, plus the final ⟨ã⟩ {{IPA|[ɐ̃]}}, which replaces the -''am'' ending, as the latter is reserved for verbs, e.g., ''amanh<u>ã</u>'' {{IPA|[amɐˈɲɐ̃]}} 'tomorrow'.
  
* Initial and middle: [[vowel]] + ⟨n⟩ + [[consonant]] (except ⟨h⟩, ⟨p⟩ or ⟨b⟩): ''<u>an</u>teced<u>en</u>te'', ''ger<u>in</u>g<u>on</u>ça'', ''m<u>un</u>do'', ''<u>ên</u>fase'' &nbsp;
* Initial and middle: [[vowel]] + ⟨m⟩ + [[bilabial consonant]] (⟨p⟩ or ⟨b⟩): ''caç<u>am</u>ba'', ''<u>em</u>prego'', ''sup<u>im</u>pa'', ''p<u>om</u>ba'', ''pen<u>um</u>bra'' &nbsp;
* Final: [[vowel]] + ⟨m⟩: ''fizer<u>am</u>'', ''<u>em</u>'', ''ru<u>im</u>'', ''b<u>om</u>'', ''alg<u>um</u>'' (except for learned words, e.g., ''abdóm<u>en</u>''/''abdôm<u>en</u>'', ''híf<u>en</u>'', etc.)

These do not alter the rules for stress, though note endings -''im'', -''ins'' and -''um'', -''uns'' are stressed, as are their non-nasal counterparts (see below). A couple of two-letter words consist of only the nasal vowel:  ''em'' and ''um''.

Phonetic vowel nasalization occurs in Spanish—vowels may get slightly nasalized in contact with nasal consonants—but it is not phonemically distinctive.  In Portuguese, on the other hand, vowel nasalization is distinctive, and therefore phonemic: ''pois'' {{IPA|/ˈpojs/}} or {{IPA|/ˈpojʃ/}} 'because' vs ''pões'' {{IPA|/ˈpõj̃s/}} or {{IPA|/ˈpõj̃ʃ/}} '(you) put'.

Portuguese changes vowel sounds with (and without) accents marks. Unaccented ⟨o⟩ ({{IPA|/u/, /o/, /ɔ/}}) and ⟨e⟩ ({{IPA|/i/, /ɨ/, /e/, /ɛ/, /ɐ/}}), acute accented ⟨ó⟩ ({{IPA|/ɔ/}}) and ⟨é⟩ ({{IPA|/ɛ/}}), or circumflex accented ⟨ô⟩ ({{IPA|/o/}}) and ⟨e⟩ ({{IPA|/e/}}).  Thus, ''nós'' {{IPA|[ˈnɔs]}} or {{IPA|[ˈnɔʃ]}} 'we' vs ''nos'' {{IPA|[nus]}} or {{IPA|[nuʃ]}} 'us', ''avô'' {{IPA|[aˈvo]}} 'grandfather' vs ''avó'' {{IPA|[aˈvɔ]}} 'grandmother', ''se'' {{IPA|[si]}} or {{IPA|[sɨ]}} 'itself, himself, herself' reflexive pronoun vs ''sé'' {{IPA|[ˈsɛ]}} 'seat, headquarters' vs ''sê'' {{IPA|[ˈse]}} 'to be' 2nd person imperative. Spanish pronunciation makes no such distinction.

The [[grave accent]] ( '''`''' ) is also used in Portuguese to indicate the [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of the preposition ''a'' (to) with a few words beginning with the vowel ''a'', but not to indicate stress. In other cases, it is the combination of the preposition and the feminine definite article; in other words, the equivalent of ''a la'' ('to the') in Spanish. ''Às'' is used for the plural (''a las'' in Spanish).

* ''a'' (prep.) + ''a(s)'' (def. article 'the') = ''à(s)'' ('to the').
* ''a'' (prep.) + ''aquele(s), aquela(s)'' (pron. 'that') = ''à<u>que</u>le(s), à<u>que</u>la(s)''—underlined stressed syllable—('to that').
* ''a'' (prep.) + ''aquilo'' (pron. n. 'that') = ''à<u>qui</u>lo'' ('to that').

The [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] or trema ( '''¨''' ) is used in Spanish to indicate ⟨u⟩ is pronounced in the sequence ⟨gu⟩; e.g., ''desagüe'' {{IPA|[deˈsaɣwe]}}. As the Portuguese grave accent, the trema does not indicate stress. In Brazilian Portuguese it was also used for the digraphs ⟨gu⟩ and ⟨qu⟩ for the same purpose as Spanish (e.g., former BP spelling *''qüinqüênio'' {{IPA|[kwĩˈkwẽɲu]}}, EP ''quinquénio'' {{IPA|[kwĩˈkwɛnju]}} 'five-year period'), however since the implementation of the Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement in Brazil, the trema was abolished (current BP spelling ''quinquênio'' {{IPA|[kwĩˈkwẽɲu]}}), and its usage was restricted to some loanwords (e.g., ''mülleriano'' 'Müllerian').

The accentuation rules (including those of predictable stress) of Portuguese and Spanish are similar, but not identical. Discrepancies are especially pervasive in words that contain ''i'' or ''u'' in their last syllable.  Note the Portuguese diphthongs ''ei'' and ''ou'' are the approximate Spanish equivalent of ''e'' and ''o'' respectively, but any word ending with these diphthongs is, by default, stressed on its final syllable.

Compare the following pairs of cognates, where the stress falls on the same syllable in both languages:

:{| cellspacing="3px"
|- 
| ''<u>ta</u>xi'', || ''vi<u>ví</u>'', || ''bam<u>bú</u>'', || ''<u>an</u>sia'', || ''<u>se</u>ria'', || ''se<u>rí</u>a'', || ''jar<u>dín</u>'', || ''pen<u>sáis</u>'', || ''pen<u>só</u>''
| (Spanish)
|- 
| ''<u>tá</u>xi'', || ''vi<u>vi</u>'', || ''bam<u>bu</u>'', || ''<u>ân</u>sia'', || ''<u>sé</u>ria'', || ''se<u>ri</u>a'', || ''jar<u>dim</u>'', || ''pen<u>sais</u>'', || ''pen<u>sou</u>''
| (Portuguese)
|}

Semivowel–vowel sequences are treated differently in both languages when it comes to accentuation rules. A sequence of a semivowel adjacent to a vowel is by default assumed to be read as a [[diphthong]] (part of the same syllable) in Spanish, whereas it is by default assumed to be read as a [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] (belonging to different syllables) in Portuguese. For both languages, accentuation rules consistently indicate something other than the default.

A consequence of this is that words that are pronounced alike in both languages are written according to different accentuation rules. Some examples:

* ''emer<u>gen</u>cia'' (Spanish), ''emer<u>gên</u>cia'' (Portuguese) 'emergency'
* ''tole<u>ran</u>cia'' (Spanish), ''tole<u>rân</u>cia'' (Portuguese) 'tolerance'
* ''au<u>da</u>cia'' (Spanish), ''au<u>dá</u>cia'' (Portuguese) 'audace'
* ''<u>o</u>cio'' (Spanish), ''<u>ó</u>cio'' (Portuguese) 'leisure'
* ''con<u>ti</u>nuo'' (Spanish), ''con<u>tí</u>nuo'' (Portuguese) 'continuous'
* ''conti<u>nú</u>o'' (Spanish), ''conti<u>nu</u>o'' (Portuguese) 'I continue'

Another consequence (though less common) is that some words are written exactly (or almost exactly) the same in both languages, but the stress falls on different syllables:

* ''demo<u>cra</u>cia'' (Spanish, [[rising diphthong]] at the end), ''democra<u>ci</u>a'' (Portuguese, the stress on -''ci''- [[Hiatus (linguistics)|breaks the diphthong]]) 'democracy'
* ''poli<u>cí</u>a'' (Spanish, the stress on -''cí''- breaks the diphthong), ''po<u>lí</u>cia'' (Portuguese) 'police'

==Phonology==
Although the vocabularies of Spanish and Portuguese are very similar (at times identical), the two languages differ phonologically from each other. Phonetically Portuguese bears some similarities to [[Catalan language|Catalan]] or to [[French language|French]] while the phonetics of Spanish are more comparable to those of [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. Portuguese has a larger phonemic inventory than Spanish. This may partially explain why it is generally not very intelligible to Spanish speakers despite the strong lexical similarity between the two languages. It is often said that it is easier for Portuguese-speakers to understand Spanish than for Spanish-speakers to understand Portuguese.

One of the main differences between the Spanish and Portuguese pronunciation are the vowel sounds. Standard Spanish has a basic vowel phonological system, with five phonemic vowels ({{IPA|{{IPAslink|ä|a}}, {{IPAslink|e̞}}, {{IPAslink|i}}, {{IPAslink|o̞}}, {{IPAslink|u}}}}). Phonetic nasalization occurs in Spanish for vowels occurring between nasal consonants or when preceding a syllable-final nasal consonant ({{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}), but it is not distinctive as in Portuguese. Dialectally, there are Spanish dialects with a greater number of vowels, with some (as Murcian and Eastern Andalusian) reaching up to 8 to 10 vowel sounds. On the other hand, Portuguese has seven to nine oral vowels ({{IPA|{{IPAslink|ä|a}}, {{IPAslink|ɐ}}*, {{IPAslink|e}}, {{IPAslink|ɛ}}, {{IPAslink|ɯ|ɨ}}*, {{IPAslink|i}}, {{IPAslink|o}}, {{IPAslink|ɔ}}, {{IPAslink|u}}}}) ({{IPA|/ɐ/}} is closer to {{IPAblink|ə}} in Portugal, while the [[close back unrounded vowel|near-close near-back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/ɨ/}}—also rendered as {{IPAblink|ɯ|ɯ̟}} or {{IPAblink|ʊ|ʊ̜}}—is only found in European Portuguese) plus five phonemic nasal vowels ({{IPA|{{IPAslink|ɐ̃}}, {{IPAslink|ẽ}}, {{IPAslink|ĩ}}, {{IPAslink|õ}}, {{IPAslink|ũ}}}}) when preceding an omitted syllable-final nasal ({{IPA|⟨n⟩}} and {{IPA|⟨m⟩}}) or when is marked with a [[tilde]] (~): ⟨ã⟩ and ⟨õ⟩. Portuguese, as Catalan, uses vowel height, contrasting stressed and unstressed (reduced) vowels. Moreover, Spanish has two semivowels as allophones, {{IPA|[{{IPA link|j}}, {{IPA link|w}}]}}; while Portuguese has four, two oral {{IPA|[{{IPA link|j|i̯}} ~ {{IPA link|ɪ|ɪ̯}}], [{{IPA link|w|u̯}} ~ {{IPA link|ʊ|ʊ̯}}]}} and two nasalized glides {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ȷ̃|j̃}} ~ ɪ̯̃], [{{IPA link|w̃}} ~ ʊ̯̃]}} (non-syllabic near-close vowels, as those of most English speech, are allophones of the glides in the Brazilian dialects where near-closeds are used).

The following considerations are based on a comparison of standard versions of Spanish and Portuguese. Apparent divergence of the information below from anyone's personal pronunciation may indicate one's idiolect (or dialect) diverges from the mentioned standards. Information on Portuguese phonology is adapted from Celso Pedro Luft ({{lang|pt|''Novo Manual de Português''}}, 1971), and information on Spanish phonology adapted from Manuel Seco ({{lang|es|''Gramática Esencial del Español''}}, 1994).

Comparing the phonemic inventory of the two languages, a noticeable divergence stands out. First, standard Portuguese has more phonemes than Spanish. Also, each language has phonemes that are not shared by the other.

===Early phonetic divergence===

====Vowels====
Spanish and Portuguese have been diverging for over a thousand years. One of the most noticeable early differences between them concerned the result of the stressed vowels of Latin:

<sup>2</sup>This diphthong has been reduced to the monophthong {{IPA|/o/}} in many dialects of modern Portuguese.
</small>

As [[vowel length]] ceased to be distinctive in the transition from Latin to [[Romance languages|Romance]], the stressed vowels {{sm|e}} and {{sm|o}} became ''ie'' and ''ue'' in Spanish whenever they were short (Latin {{sm|petra}} → Spanish ''piedra'' 'stone'; Latin {{sm|moritvr}} → Spanish ''muere'' "he dies"). Similar [[diphthong]]izations can be found in other Romance languages ([[French language|French]] ''pierre'', Italian ''pietra'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''piatră''; French ''meurt'', Italian ''muore'', Romanian ''moare''), but in [[Galician-Portuguese]] these vowels underwent a qualitative change instead (Portuguese/Galician ''pedra'', ''morre''), becoming [[vowel height|lower]], as also happened with short {{sm|i}} and short {{sm|u}} in stressed syllables. The Classical Latin vowels {{IPA|/e/}}-{{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}-{{IPA|/oː/}} were correspondingly lowered in Spanish and turned into diphthongs {{IPA|/je̞/}} and {{IPA|/we̞/}}. In Spanish, short {{sm|e}} and {{sm|o}} and long {{sm|ē}} and {{sm|ō}} merged into [[mid vowel]]s, {{IPA|/e̞/}} and {{IPA|/o̞/}}, while in Portuguese these vowels stayed as [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]], {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} and [[open-mid]], {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, as in Vulgar Latin.

Portuguese has five phonemic [[nasal vowel]]s ({{IPA|/ɐ̃/, /ẽ/, /ĩ/, /õ/, /ũ/}}), which, according to historical linguistics, arose from the [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of the nasal consonants {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, often at the [[syllable coda|end of syllables]]. Syllable-final ''m'' and ''n'' are still written down to indicate nasalization, even though they are no longer fully pronounced, that is, either {{IPA|[ⁿ]}} (before [[obstruent]]s) or elided completely. In other cases, nasal vowels are marked with a [[tilde]] (''ã'', ''õ'').  Not all words containing ''vowel + n'' have the nasal sound, as the subsequent letter must be a consonant for this to occur: e.g., ''anel'' {{IPA|/ɐˈnɛw/}} ('ring') –oral/non-nasal– vs  ''anca'' {{IPA|/ˈɐ̃kɐ/}} ('hip') –nasal–.

However, in some Brazilian dialects, most vowels (including the allophones present only in unstressed environment) have nasal allophones before one of the nasal consonants {{IPA|/m/, /n/, /ɲ/}}, followed by another vowel. In other Brazilian dialects, only stressed vowels can be nasalized this way. In European Portuguese, nasalization is absent in this environment.

The Portuguese [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ou'' (pronounced usually as the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[ow]}}, but sometimes as a [[monophthong]] {{IPA|[o]}}) corresponds to the final ''-ó'' of Spanish ''-ar'' verbs in the [[preterite]] tense; e.g., Spanish ''descansó'' and Portuguese ''descansou'' ("he/she rested"). The Spanish irregular verb forms in ''-oy'' (e.g., ''doy'' "I give", ''estoy'' "I am", ''soy'' "I am", ''voy'' "I go") correspond to Portuguese forms in ''-ou'' (e.g., ''dou'', ''estou'', ''sou'', ''vou''). But in some other words, conversely, Spanish ''o'' corresponds to Portuguese ''oi'', e.g., Spanish ''cosa'', Portuguese ''coisa'' "thing"; Spanish ''oro'' "gold", Portuguese usually ''ouro'', but sometimes ''oiro''.

Stressed vowel alternations may occur in Portuguese, but not in Spanish:

=====Unstressed vowels=====
The history of the unstressed vowels in Spanish and Portuguese is not as well known as that of the stressed vowels, but some points are generally agreed upon. Spanish has the five short vowels of classical Latin, {{IPA|/a/, /e̞/, /i/, /o̞/, /u/}}. It has also two semivowels, {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}}, that appear in diphthongs, but these can be considered allophones of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, respectively. The pronunciation of the unstressed vowels does not differ much from that of stressed vowels. Unstressed, non-syllabic {{IPA|/e̞/}} {{IPA|/o̞/}}, and {{IPA|/a/}} can be reduced to {{IPA|[ʝ]}}, {{IPA|[w̝]}} and complete elision in some dialects; e.g., ''poetisa'' {{IPA|[pw̝e̞ˈtisa]}} ('poet' [[grammatical gender|f.]]), ''línea'' {{IPA|[ˈlinʝa]}} ('line'), ''ahorita'' {{IPA|[o̞ˈɾita]}} ('now').

The system of seven oral vowels of Vulgar Latin has been fairly well preserved in Portuguese, as in the closely related [[Galician language]]. In Portuguese, unstressed vowels have been more unstable, both diachronically (across time) and synchronically (between dialects), producing new vowel sounds. The vowels written ⟨a⟩, ⟨e⟩ and ⟨o⟩ are pronounced in different ways according to several factors, most notably whether they are stressed, and whether they occur in the last syllable of a word. The basic paradigm is shown in the following table (it has some exceptions).

<sup>§</sup> Always nasalized in this environment, that is, {{IPA|[ɐ̃ ~ ə̃]}}

<sup>1</sup> Only in Florianópolis, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and eastern Minas Gerais.

<sup>2</sup> Only before stressed syllables

<sup>3</sup> Only in Northeastern Brazil. In some other dialects (including those of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais), this also occurs if the stressed vowel is open rather than closed (ɛ or ɔ, rather than e or o). It can be said that the opening of the stressed vowel influences the vowels of the preceding syllables to open too, while in other dialects they would remain closed. This means that ''europeia'' is pronounced /euɾɔ'pɛiɐ/, rather than /euɾo'pɛiɐ/, like in other dialects. In contrast, ''europeu'' is pronounced /euɾo'peu/ everywhere. This phenomenon affects all the syllables preceding the stressed one, as seen in the words ''perereca'' /pɛɾɛ'ɾɛkɐ/ and ''voçoroca'' /vɔsɔ'ɾɔkɐ/. While ''toró'' is /tɔ'ɾɔ/, ''torá'' is /to'ɾa/, with the first O remaining closed. This is because /a/ is not "perceived" as an open vowel, because it has no closed counterpart in this situation (unlike ɛ and ɔ, which have e and o as counterparts), hence its openness is taken for granted; I and U too are always open in stressed position.

<sup><nowiki># </nowiki></sup>Only in some dialects, the first mainly in the area including and surrounding Lisbon (not present in much of northern and insular Portugal, as in Brazil), and the latter mainly in some hinterland northern Portuguese accents (not present in southern and insular Portugal, as in Brazil)

Brazilian unstressed vowel allophones are easy to guess by their geographical distribution. While [[Near-close vowel|near-close]] {{IPA|[ʊ]}}, {{IPA|[ɪ]}} and unstressed [[Close-mid vowel|close-mid]] {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|[o]}} are found in southern and western accents, where postvocalic ars are "soft" (flap, coronal approximant or rhotic vowel) and postvocalic sibilants (written ⟨s⟩, ⟨x⟩, and ⟨z⟩) in native words are ''always'' alveolar {{IPA|[s, z]}}, they do not happen in the northern and eastern accents where postvocalic ars are "hard" (guttural) and postvocalic sibilants ''may be'', consistently or not, post-alveolar {{IPA|[ʃ, ʒ, ɕ, ʑ]}}. In the accents where postvocalic sibilants are ''always'' post-alveolar, such as those of Florianópolis and Rio de Janeiro, or in the accents influenced by them, ''any'' unstressed {{IPA|/a ~ ɐ/}}, {{IPA|[e̞ ~ ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[o̞ ~ ɔ]}} may be raised (like in Portugal), to {{IPA|[ɐ]}}, {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[u]}}, respectively (while this is true of all casual BP, it is especially characterist of those).

Similar [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] patterns to these exist in other Romance languages such as Catalan or Occitan. Although it is mostly an allophonic variation, some dialects have developed minimal pairs that distinguish the stressed variants from the unstressed ones. The vowel {{IPAslink|ɯ|ɨ}} is often elided in connected speech (it is not present in Brazilian Portuguese).

Some Brazilian dialects diphthongize stressed vowels to {{IPA|[ai̯], [ɛi̯], [ei̯]}}, etc. (except {{IPA|/i/}}), before a sibilant at the end of a syllable (written ⟨s⟩, ⟨x⟩, ⟨z⟩, or rarely, ⟨sh⟩). For instance, ''Jesus'' {{IPA|[ʒe̞ˈzui̯s]}} 'Jesus', ''faz'' {{IPA|[ˈfai̯s]}} 'he does', ''dez'' {{IPA|[ˈdɛi̯s]}} 'ten'. This has led to the use of ''meia'' (meaning ''meia dúzia'', 'half a dozen') for ''seis'' {{IPA|[sei̯s]}} 'six' when making enumerations, to avoid any confusion with'' três'' {{IPA|[tɾei̯s]}} 'three' on the telephone. In [[Lisbon]] and surrounding areas, stressed {{IPA|/e/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ɐ]}} or {{IPA|[ɐj]}} when it comes before an alveolo-palatal {{IPA|/ʎ/, /ɲ/, [ɕ], [ʑ]}} or palato-alveolar {{IPA|/ʃ/, /ʒ/}} consonants followed by another vowel.

The orthography of Portuguese, which is partly etymological and analogical, does not indicate these sound changes. This makes the written language look deceptively similar to Spanish. For example, although ''breve'' ('brief') is spelled the same in both languages, it is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈbɾe̞βe̞]}} in Spanish, but {{IPA|[ˈbɾɛvi ~ ˈbɾɛv(ɨ)]}} in Portuguese. In Brazilian Portuguese, in the vast majority of cases, the only difference between final -''e'' and -''i'' is the stress, as both are pronounced as {{IPA|/i/}}. The former is unstressed, and the latter is stressed without any diacritical mark. In European Portuguese, final -''e'' is usually not pronounced or is pronounced like {{IPA|[ɨ]}}), unlike ''i'', which is pronounced {{IPA|[i]}}.

Peculiar to early Spanish (as in the [[Gascon language|Gascon]] dialect of Occitan, possibly due to a [[Basque language|Basque]] substratum) was the loss of Latin initial {{sm|f}}- whenever it was followed by a vowel that did not diphthongize. Thus, Spanish ''hijo'' and ''hablar'' correspond to Portuguese ''filho'' and ''falar'' (from Latin {{sm|filivm}} and {{sm|fabvlāre}}, 'son' and 'to speak' respectively). Nevertheless, Portuguese ''fogo'' corresponds to Spanish ''fuego'' (from Latin {{sm|focvm}} 'fire').

Another typical difference concerned the result of Latin -{{sm|l}}- and -{{sm|n}}- in [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]] position:

* When single, they were retained in Spanish but [[elision|elided]] in Portuguese. Often, the loss of the consonant was followed by the merger of the two surrounding vowels (as in the examples in the table above), or by the insertion of an [[epenthetic vowel]] between them (Latin {{sm|arenam}} → Spanish ''arena'', Portuguese ''arẽa'', today ''areia'' 'sand').

* When [[Consonant length|double]], they developed into the Spanish palatals ⟨ll⟩ {{IPAslink|ʎ}} (merged with {{IPAslink|ʝ}} in most contemporary Spanish dialects) and ⟨ñ⟩ {{IPAslink|ɲ}}. Indeed, the Spanish [[ñ|letter ⟨ñ⟩]] was originally a shorthand for {{sm|nn}}. In Portuguese, -{{sm|ll}}- and -{{sm|nn}}- just became single, ⟨l⟩ {{IPAslink|l}} and ⟨n⟩ {{IPAslink|n}}, respectively.

* When followed by the [[semivowel]] {{sm|i}}, {{sm|l}} coalesced with it into a ⟨j⟩ {{IPAslink|x}} in Spanish. In Portuguese, {{sm|l}} and {{sm|n}} followed by semivowel {{sm|i}} were [[palatalization|palatalized]] into ⟨lh⟩ {{IPAslink|ʎ}} and ⟨nh⟩ {{IPAslink|ɲ}}, respectively.

Other [[consonant cluster]]s of Latin also took markedly different routes in the two languages in their archaic period:

Learned words such as ''pleno, ocular, no(c)turno, tremular'', and so on, were not included in the examples above, since they were adapted directly from [[Classical Latin]] in later times.

The tables above represent only general trends with many exceptions, due to:
# Other phonological processes at work in old Spanish and old Portuguese, which interfered with these.
# Later [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] by analogy with related words.
# Later borrowing of [[Latinism|learned word]]s directly from Latin, especially since the Renaissance, which did not respect the original sound laws.
# Mutual borrowing, from Spanish to Portuguese or vice versa.

====Synaeresis====
Portuguese has tended to eliminate [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatuses]] that were preserved in Spanish, merging similar consecutive vowels into one (often after the above-mentioned loss of intervocalic -{{sm|l}}- and -{{sm|n}}-). This results in many Portuguese words being one syllable shorter than their Spanish cognates:

:''creído'', ''leer'', ''mala'', ''manzana'', ''mañana'', ''poner'', ''reír'', ''venir'' (Spanish)
:''crido'', ''ler'', ''má'', ''maçã'', ''manhã'', ''pôr'', ''rir'', ''vir'' (Portuguese)

In other cases, Portuguese reduces consecutive vowels to a diphthong, again resulting in one syllable fewer:

:''a-te-o'', ''eu-ro-pe-o'', ''pa-lo'', ''ve-lo'' (Spanish)
:''a-teu'', ''eu-ro-peu'', ''pau'', ''véu'' (Portuguese)

There are nevertheless a few words where the opposite happened, such as Spanish ''comprender'' versus Portuguese ''compreender'', from Latin ''comprehendere''.

===Different sounds with the same spelling===
Since the late Middle Ages, both languages have gone through sound shifts and mergers that set them further apart.

====Sibilants====
The most marked phonetic divergence between Spanish and Portuguese in their modern period concerned the evolution of the [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]]s. In the Middle Ages, both had a rich system of seven sibilants – paired according to affrication and voicing: {{IPAslink|s}}, {{IPAslink|ts}}, {{IPAslink|z}}, {{IPAslink|dz}}, {{IPAslink|ʃ}}, {{IPAslink|tʃ}}, and {{IPAslink|dʒ}} (the latter probably in [[free variation]] with {{IPAslink|ʒ}}, as still happens today in [[Ladino language|Ladino]]) – and spelled virtually the same in Spanish and Portuguese.

<small><sup>1</sup>Before vowels; in the coda position, there are dialectal variations within each language, not discussed here.</small><br>
<small><sup>2</sup>Modern Portuguese has for the most part kept the medieval spelling.</small>

After the Renaissance, the two languages reduced their inventory of sibilants, but in different ways:

* Devoicing in Spanish: the [[voiced consonant|voiced]] sibilants written ⟨-s-⟩, ⟨z⟩ and ⟨j/g⟩ became voiceless, merging with ⟨s-/-ss-⟩, ⟨c/ç⟩ and ⟨x⟩, respectively. In many Spanish dialects, modern ⟨c/z⟩ {{IPAslink|θ}} also merged with ⟨s⟩ {{IPAslink|s}} (''[[seseo]]''). Later, the [[voiceless palato-alveolar fricative|palato-alveolar fricative]] ⟨x⟩ {{IPAslink|ʃ}} changed into the [[voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]] {{IPAslink|x}}, while ⟨ch⟩ stay unchanged {{IPAslink|tʃ}}. Spanish spelling has been updated according to these sound changes.

* Deaffrication in Portuguese: the [[affricate consonant|affricates]] written ⟨c/ç⟩, ⟨z⟩ and ⟨ch⟩ became plain fricatives, merging with the sibilants ⟨s-/-ss-⟩, ⟨-s-⟩ and ⟨x⟩ in most dialects, respectively. In spite of this, modern Portuguese has for the most part kept the medieval spelling.

* Deaffrication in Portuguese: some rural hinterland northern Portuguese dialects as well the [[Mirandese language]] preserved the medieval distinction, still indicated by the spelling, with the former affricates being voiceless [[Laminal consonant|laminal]], voiced laminal and still voiceless post-alveolar affricate {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, respectively, and the sibilants being voiceless [[Apical consonant|apical]], voiced apical and voiceless palato-alveolar. As much of Brazilian Portuguese, these dialects have alveolar coda sibilants, though a [[voiceless apico-alveolar fricative]] has a hushing-like sound, more similar to {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.

| ''r-'', ''-rr-'' || {{IPA|[r]}} || {{IPA|[ʁ]}} || align=left | In Portuguese, ''r-'' and ''-rr-'' have several possible pronunciations.

In some southern and western Brazilian dialects word final ''-r'' may be a tap (as in Portugal and Galicia), though English-like {{IPAblink|ɹ}}, {{IPAblink|ɻ}} or {{IPAblink|ɚ}} is more common, while in northern and eastern dialects it is guttural. In Spanish, ''r-'' and ''-rr-'' have kept their original pronunciation as an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPAblink|r}}. Intervocalic ''-r-'' is an [[Alveolar flap|alveolar tap]] in both languages {{IPAblink|ɾ}}.
|- align=center
| ''v'' || {{IPA|[b ~ β]}} || {{IPA|[v]}} || align=left | Originally, the letters ⟨b⟩ and ⟨v⟩ stood for distinct sounds pronounced {{IPAblink|b}} and {{IPAblink|β}}, respectively, but the two eventually merged into a single [[phoneme]] in Spanish. In most varieties of Portuguese they remained separate phonemes, and the [[voiced bilabial fricative|bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[β]}} of Old Portuguese subsequently changed into the [[voiced labiodental fricative|labiodental fricative]] {{IPAblink|v}}, as in French and [[Italian language|Italian]].
|}

Since no distinction is made anymore between the pronunciation of ⟨b⟩ and ⟨v⟩, Spanish spelling has been reformed according to Classical Latin. In Portuguese, the spelling of these letters is based on pronunciation, which is closer to Vulgar Latin and modern Italian. This leads to some orthographic disparities:

* Compare for example Spanish ''gobierno'', ''haber'', ''libro'' with Portuguese ''governo'', ''haver'', ''livro''.
* The endings of the imperfect indicative tense of 1st. conjugation verbs (with infinitives ending in ''-ar'') are spelled with ⟨b⟩ in Spanish (''cantaba'', ''cantabas'', ''cantábamos'', and so on), but with ⟨v⟩ in Portuguese (''cantava'', ''cantavas'', ''cantávamos'', etc.)
* The Spanish adjectival suffix ''-ble'', as in ''posible'' (also used in English, "possible"), corresponds to ''-vel'' in Portuguese: ''possível''.

In Spanish, the plosives ''b'', ''d'', ''g'' are [[lenition|lenited]], usually realized as "soft" [[approximant consonant|approximants]] {{IPA|[β̞, ð̞, ɣ̞]}} (here represented without the undertracks) after [[continuant]]s. While similar pronunciations can be heard in [[European Portuguese]], most speakers of Portuguese pronounce these phonemes consistently as "hard" [[plosives]] {{IPA|[b, d, ɡ]}}. This can make a Portuguese phrase such as ''uma bala'' ("a bullet") sound like ''una pala'' ("a shovel") to a Spanish-speaker.
