|No [[native resolution]]. Currently, the only display technology capable of multi-syncing (displaying different resolutions and refresh rates without the need for scaling). [[Display lag]] is extremely low due to its nature, which does not have the ability to store image data before output, unlike LCDs, plasma displays and OLED displays.
|The LCD grid can mask effects of spatial and grayscale quantization, creating the illusion of higher image quality.<ref>M. d’Zmura, T. P. Janice Shen, Wei Wu, Homer Chen, and Marius Vassiliou (1998), “Contrast Gain Control for Color Image Quality,” IS&T/SPIE Conference on Human Vision and Electronic Imaging III, San Jose, California, January 1998, SPIE Vol. 3299, 194–201.</ref> <br>Many newer models are powered by an external 12V power supply (for thinness), and could (with a special cable) be connected directly to the computer's power supply, possibly saving power, desk space and wall-outlet space
