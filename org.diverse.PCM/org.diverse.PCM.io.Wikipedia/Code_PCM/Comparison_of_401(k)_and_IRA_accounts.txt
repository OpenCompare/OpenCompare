==Roth vs. Traditional==

The decision between choosing a Roth IRA vs. a Traditional IRA depends mostly on whether you are likely to be in a higher [[tax rate]] in the future (in which case a Roth IRA is better) or a lower tax rate in the future (in which case a conventional IRA is better). Roth IRAs also have a bit more flexibility in terms of early withdrawal. If your tax rate does not change while you are working vs. when you retire, you will end up with the same amount of money in a Roth IRA as a conventional IRA for a donation less than the maximum allowable. If you save the maximum allowable amount in an IRA, ''and you stay at the same tax rate'', there is a tax advantage to the Roth-IRA. For instance, in 2007 the maximum traditional IRA for a 40 year old was $4000. Any additional investment above that would have to go into a different account.

Example:
:Below examples show how the value of one year's maximum contribution grows over 30 years, assuming a 10% rate of return and a 25% income tax rate.

:''Roth IRA.'' A $5000 contribution to a Roth-IRA will grow to $5000 * 1.1<sup>30</sup> = $87,247. This $5000 contribution is not tax-deductible, the contribution will effectively cost 5000 / (1-0.25) = $6667.

:''Traditional IRA.'' A $5000 contribution to a traditional IRA will also grow to $87,247 using the same assumptions and calculations above. When withdrawn, the account is taxed, leaving an available amount of 87,247 * (1 - 0.25) = $65,435. However, if given the same earned $6667 as above, the investor has an additional ($6667 - $5000) * (1 - 0.25) = $1250 to invest in another financial product.
::If this $1250 is invested in an account that pays interest, it will grow to 1250 * (1 + .1 * [1-.25])<sup>30</sup> = $10,944. The total after-tax amount is $65,435 + $10,944 = $76,379 (14% less than the above Roth IRA).
::If the $1677 is able to be invested into a 401(k) or other tax-exempt investment plan, it would grow to 1667 * 1.1<sup>30</sup> = $29,088. When taxed upon withdrawal, would leave 29,088 * (1 - 0.25) = $21,816.  Total after-tax amount is 65,435 + 21,816 = $87,247, just like in the Roth IRA.

:''Explanation.'' More money can effectively be placed into the Roth IRA and grow tax-free, making it the better choice if the investor wants to maximize tax-advantaged contributions.
