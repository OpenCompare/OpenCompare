[[Esperanto]] and [[Novial]] are two different [[constructed language|constructed]] [[international auxiliary languages]]. Their main difference is that while Esperanto is a schematic language, with an invarying grammar, Novial is a naturalistic language, whose grammar and vocabulary varies to try to retain a "natural" sound. Demographically, Esperanto has thousands of times more speakers than Novial.

==Alphabet and pronunciation==
Both Esperanto and Novial are written using versions of the [[Latin alphabet]]. The Esperanto alphabet has 28 letters: 22 without [[diacritic]]s and 6 with diacritics unique to Esperanto: ''ĉ'', ''ĝ'', ''ĥ'', ''ĵ'', ''ŝ'' and ''ŭ''. Novial uses the standard 26 letters of the Latin alphabet with no diacritics.

In Esperanto one letter corresponds to one [[phoneme]] and one phoneme to one letter: there are no digraphs. Novial has 3 [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: ''ch'', ''sh'' and ''qu''; ''c'' and ''q'' are unique to these digraphs (except in foreign proper nouns) and permit no ambiguity; when ''s'' and ''h'' are separate phonemes this is indicated by separating with a hyphen: ''s-h''.  Novial permits some 2-vowel combinations to be pronounced either as 2 separate [[vowel]]s or as [[diphthong]]s; for example, ''au'', ''eu'' and ''oi'' may be pronounced as ''a + w'', ''e + w'' and ''o + y'', respectively, and ''ie'', ''io'' and ''ia'' as ''y + e'', ''y + o'' and ''y + a'', respectively.

In handwriting neither Esperanto nor Novial presents any problem. However, the diacritics of Esperanto require special methods for typing and printing. The original method was a set of digraphs now known as the "h-system", but with the rise of computer word processing a so-called "x-system" has become equally popular. These systems are described in the article [[Esperanto orthography]]. However, with the advent of [[Unicode]], the need for such work-arounds has lessened.

==Personal pronouns==

The [[personal pronoun]]s of Esperanto all end in ''i'' and some may be difficult to distinguish in a noisy environment (especially ''mi'' and ''ni''). The personal pronouns of Novial use various vowels making them more distinct, although some differ only in the initial consonant (e.g. ''nus'', ''vus'' and ''lus''). A later form of ''nus'' – ''nos'', more distinct from ''vus'' – has sometimes been used. Novial does not distinguish familiar and polite forms of “you” (e.g. French ''tu'' and ''vous''). Novial’s inventor argued that such a distinction has no place in a language intended solely for international use. The distinction is available in Esperanto <sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i>[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|<span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2011)">citation needed</span>]]</i>&#93;</sup> but is little used in practice.

<small>¹ ''ci'' and ''thou'', while technically the familiar form of the word "you" in Esperanto and English, respectively, are almost never used. Results on Google have shown that ''ci''  is used less than half of one percent of the amount ''vi'' is in Esperanto. Zamenhof himself did not include the pronoun in the first book on Esperanto and only later reluctantly; later he recommended against using ''ci'' on the grounds that different cultures have conflicting traditions regarding the use of the familiar and formal forms of "you", and that a universal language should avoid the problem by simply using the formal form in all situations. Novial uses only ''vu'' as the singular "you".

² ''tiu'', "that person", is usually used in this circumstance, because many people find it unnatural to use "it" referring to humans.
</small>

The Novial system displays a systematic correspondence between singular and corresponding plural forms (i.e. ''vu'', ''vus''; ''lo'', ''los''; ''la'', ''las''; ''lu'', ''lus''; ''le'', ''les''). Strictly speaking "we" is not the plural of "I", because "many I’s" is nonsensical. Jespersen suggested that ''nu'', the singular of ''nus'', could be used as a "royal we". The optional marking of sex in Novial, especially in the third person plural, permits greater flexibility than in Esperanto, at least in this case. Exactly the same system is applied to other pronouns and to nouns with natural sex differences.

==Marking gender==

The system of [[Esperanto vocabulary#Gender|sex marking for Esperanto nouns]] is frequently criticised for being asymmetric and male biased. In contrast Novial has one symmetric, unbiased system for both nouns and pronouns which marks either male, female, [[epicene]] or inanimate.

==Verbal systems==

The grammars of Novial and Esperanto differ greatly in the way that the various [[grammatical tense|tense]]s, [[grammatical mood|mood]]s and [[grammatical voice|voice]]s of [[verb]]s are expressed. Both use a combination of [[auxiliary verb]]s and verb endings. However, Novial uses many more auxiliary verbs and few endings, while Esperanto uses only one auxiliary verb and a greater number of verb endings.

In Novial all verb forms are independent of person (1st, 2nd or 3rd persons) and number (singular or plural). In Esperanto verb forms are independent of the person but compound tenses, with [[participle]]s, require the participle (which is an adjective) to agree with the subject of the verb in number (singular or plural). 

The [[continuous tense]]s are less common in both Esperanto and Novial than in English.

In the following table endings are separated from stems by hyphens. Alternative forms with the same meaning are in brackets. In the Esperanto forms (j) indicates agreement when the subject of the verb is plural.

===Passive voice===

The difference between the '''passive of becoming''' and the '''passive of being''' is not always immediately obvious to English speakers because their forms can often be the same. However, in English the passive of becoming is often expressed with the verb ''get'' in the sense of ''become'' as well as with the verb ''be''. 

====Passive voice of becoming====

Esperanto uses an appropriate form of the [[auxiliary verb]] ''esti'' (''to be'') followed by a passive participle (present, past or future according to sense). With many verbs Esperanto may, instead of the passive voice, use the suffix ''-iĝ-'' to form an intransitive verb of becoming, which is conjugated in the active voice (see table below).

Novial uses the auxiliary verb ''bli'' (''to get, become, be'' from the equivalent auxiliary verb ''bli'' in Scandinavian languages) followed by the root form of the verb. The various tenses and moods are expressed regularly using the other auxiliary verbs ''ha'', ''had'', ''sal'', ''saled'' and ''vud'', the word order corresponding to the English.

|}

====Passive voice of being====

The passive voice of being is generally expressed in English with an appropriate form of the verb ''to be'' followed by the past participle. It is formed in the same way in Esperanto and Novial. Note  that in contrast to the passive of becoming, in the Novial passive of being the auxiliary verb is followed by the past participle, which ends in ''-t''.

== Word formation ==
In Esperanto, most words are created from a set number of roots, endings, and affixes. This allows for a comparatively low number of words to be extended to a described vocabulary, resulting in easy learning. However, some<sup class="noprint Inline-Template " style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i>[[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Unsupported attributions|<span title="The material near this tag possibly uses too-vague attribution or weasel words. (October 2011)">who?</span>]]</i>&#93;</sup> argue that results in heavy reliance on common affixes. For example, Esperanto notoriously<span class="citation-needed-content" style="background-color: #fff9f9; color: DarkSlateGray; border: 1px solid #ffdcdc;"></span><sup class="noprint Inline-Template " style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i>[[Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words|<span title="The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution. (October 2011)">according to whom?</span>]]</i>&#93;</sup> relies heavily on the prefix ''mal-'' to form the opposite of an adjective or verb.  The equivalent prefix in Novial, ''des-'', is used to a much lesser degree.

Here is [[the Lord's Prayer]] in both languages:

{|
|-
||'''Esperanto version:'''
:Patro nia, kiu estas en la ĉielo,
:Via nomo estu sanktigita.
:Venu Via regno,
:plenumiĝu Via volo,
:kiel en la ĉielo, tiel ankaŭ sur la tero.
:Nian panon ĉiutagan donu al ni hodiaŭ.
:Kaj pardonu al ni niajn ŝuldojn,
:kiel ankaŭ ni pardonas al niaj ŝuldantoj.
:Kaj ne konduku nin en tenton,
:sed liberigu nin de la malbono.
:Amen. 
||'''Novial version:'''
:Nusen Patre, kel es in siele,
:mey vun nome bli sanktifika,
:mey vun regno veni;
:mey on fa vun volio 
:kom in siele anke sur tere.
:Dona a nus disidi li omnidiali pane,
:e pardona a nus nusen ofensos,
:kom anke nus pardona a nusen ofensantes,
:e non dukte nus en tentatione,
:ma liberisa nus fro malu.  
:Amen.
