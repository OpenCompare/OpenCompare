{{Update|date=March 2014}}
This is a comparison of consumer and commercial [[Router (computing)|network routers]] in regard to their support of the [[IPv6]] protocol.  Many popular routers (e.g., Cisco EAxxxx series) are not included here, so treat this list as a guide, but not a comprehensive compilation.
