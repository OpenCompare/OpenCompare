! ARM Research Labs, LLC [http://www.gbudb.com/ GBUdb]

! Truncate

| [http://www.gbudb.com/truncate/]

| truncate.gbudb.net

| Extremely conservative list of single IP4 addresses that produce exclusively spam/malware as indicated by the GBUdb IP Reputation system. Most systems should be able to safely reject connections based on this list.

| Automatic: IPs are added when the GBUdb "cloud" statistics reach a probability figure that indicates 95% of messages produce a spam/malware pattern match and a confidence figure that indicates sufficient data to trust the probability data.

| Automatic: Continuous while reputation statistics remain bad. Warning: Produces false positives, and has no remedy/removal process. IPs are dropped quickly if the statistics improve (within an hour). IPs are dropped within 36 hours (typ) if no more messages are seen (dead zombie).

| Source data is derived from a global network of Message Sniffer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armresearch.com/ |title=armresearch.com |publisher=armresearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref> filtering nodes in real-time. Truncate data is updated from statistics every 10 minutes.

| N/A<br />(paid access via rsync)

| Single IP addresses which only send UBE. Specializing in snowshoe spam and other 'under the radar' spams which evade many other DNSBLs. Has FP-level comparable to Zen.

| Automatic (upon receipt of a spam to a real person's mailbox), with extensive whitelists and filtering to prevent false positives

| Typically an automatic expiration 11 days after the last abuse was seen, but with some exceptions

| Spam samples are always kept on file for each listing. Removal requests are manually reviewed and processed without fees.

! ivmSIP/24

| N/A<br />(paid access via rsync)

| lists /24 blocks of IP addresses which usually only send UBE and containing at least several addresses which are confirmed emitters of junk mail. Collateral listings are kept to a minimum because subsections are often carved from /24 listings when spammers and legit senders share the same /24 block.

| Automatic once at least several IP addresses from a given block are individually listed on ivmSIP, with extensive whitelists and filtering to prevent false positives

| expiration time increases to many weeks as the fraction of IP addresses in the /24 block in question sending junk mail increases

| Removal requests are quickly and manually reviewed and processed without fees.

| yes

| Automatic (upon receipt of a spam to a real person's mailbox), with extensive whitelists and filtering to prevent false positives

| Typically an automatic expiration several weeks after the last abuse was seen.

| Spam samples are always kept on file for each listing. Removal requests are quickly and manually reviewed and processed without fees.

==Notes==

"Collateral Listings" - Deliberately listing non-offending IP addresses, in order to coerce ISPs to take action against spammers under their control.

"Notifies upon listing" - Warns the owner of the IP/Domain when they list an IP. (so owners can take action to fix the problem)
