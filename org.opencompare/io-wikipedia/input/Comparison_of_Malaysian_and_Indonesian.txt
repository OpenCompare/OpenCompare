The '''[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]''' (''Bahasa Indonesia'') and '''[[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]''' (''Bahasa Malaysia'') standards of the [[Malay language]] (''Bahasa Melayu'') are [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], but differ in spelling, pronunciation, and vocabulary. The differences can range from those mutually unintelligible with one another to those having a closer familial resemblance. The regionalized and localized varieties of Malay can become a catalyst for intercultural conflict, especially in higher education.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.educ.utas.edu.au/users/tle/JOURNAL/issues/2007/22-1.pdf |title=The Reality of Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia in Academia |author=Hafriza Burhanudeen, Nor Zakiah Abdul Hamid, Norsimah Mat Awal & Mohd

==Perception==
To non-native speakers both varieties may seem identical, but to native speakers, the differences are noticeable through diction and accent. These differences often lead to incomprehension when used in formal conversation or written communication.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} They also affect broadcasting business in relation to foreign language subtitling, for example DVD movies or TV cable subscriptions. In order to reach a wider audience, sometimes both Indonesian and Malaysian subtitles are displayed in a movie with other language subtitles. Another example is Malaysian TV provides Malaysian subtitling on Indonesian [[sinetron]]s (TV drama) aired in Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://myindo.com/story/278.asp |title=The Wonderful World of Subtitling |author=Fairy Mahzan |date= |work= |publisher=MyIndo.com |accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref>

The Malay language in Indonesia and Malaysia also differs in recognition and general perception by the people and government of the two countries. Ignorance of these subtleties may result in misconceptions.

The term "Malay" (''Bahasa Melayu'') in Indonesia and Malaysia invites different perceptions. To Malaysians, the Malay language is generally the [[national language]] of Malaysia. "Malaysian" (''Bahasa Malaysia'') is the Malaysian [[Standard dialect|standardized]] form of Malay. Between 1986 and 2007, the term ''Bahasa Melayu'' was used instead of ''Bahasa Malaysia'', until the latter was reinstated, in order to instil a sense of belonging among Malaysians of all races, rather than just [[Malay people|Malays]].<ref>[http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_126067.html Bahasa Melayu becomes Bahasa Malaysia again], ''[[Straits Times]]'', June 5, 2007</ref>  Therefore, there is no clear distinction between the use of the term Malay (''Bahasa Melayu'') and the national language of Malaysia (''Bahasa Malaysia''). In Brunei, where Malay is also an official language, the language is known as ''Bahasa Melayu'' and in English as "Malay".<ref>[http://bruneitimes.com.bn/art-culture/2010/08/04/perambahan-unique-feature-brunei-malay Perambahan: A unique feature of Brunei Malay], ''[[Brunei Times]]'', August 4, 2010</ref>

In Indonesia, however, there is a clear distinction between "Malay" (''Bahasa Melayu'') and the "Indonesian" (''Bahasa Indonesia''). Indonesian is the national language which serves as the [[Lingua franca|unifying language]] of Indonesia. The term "Malay" is reserved for the language indigenous to the Malay people. Thus, "Malay" is considered a [[regional language]] in Indonesia, enjoying the same status as [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Batak (Indonesia)#Language|Bataknese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], [[Buginese language|Buginese]], [[Balinese language|Balinese]] and others. Moreover, to Indonesians, the term "Malay" is more often associated with Malaysia and the Malaysian national language.

In Malaysia, the terms "Indonesian Malay" and "Malaysian Malay" are sometimes used for Indonesian and Malaysian as spoken in Malaysia. In Indonesia, "Indonesian Malay" refers to the Malay spoken by the [[Malay Indonesian|Malay people in Indonesia]], that is, to Malay as a regional language in [[Sumatra]], though it is rarely used. ''Bahasa Malaysia'' and ''Bahasa Melayu'' are used interchangeably in reference to Malay in Malaysia.

==Orthography==

Before the 20th century, Malay was written in a modified form of the [[Arabic alphabet]] known as [[Jawi script|Jawi]]. After the 20th century, Malay written with [[Roman letters]], known as Rumi, has almost completely replaced Jawi in everyday life. The romanisations originally used in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] (now part of [[Malaysia]]) and the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) reflected their positions as British and Dutch possessions respectively. In Malaya, the romanisation of Malay, devised by [[Richard James Wilkinson|Richard Wilkinson]]<ref>''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JHgsfADZF9IC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=wilkinson+malay+orthography&source=bl&ots=f2ees7OY7n&sig=UtkzvI0r_yC7xsTmzHfZm6qzTL8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=T_inT6jbGcrZ8AOXqpmCBQ&ved=0CE8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=wilkinson%20&f=false Spelling and Society: The Culture and Politics of Orthography Around the World]'', Mark Sebba, Cambridge University Press, 2007</ref> was influenced by English, whereas in the Dutch East Indies, the system devised by C A Van Ophuijsen was influenced by [[Dutch language|Dutch]].<ref>''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=A9UjLYD9jVEC&pg=PA91&dq=van+ophuijsen+indonesia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=K_qnT9KKAcPm8QO2mdXOBA&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=van%20ophuijsen%20indonesia&f=false The Indonesian Language: Its History and Role in Modern Society]'', James N. Sneddon, UNSW Press, 2003</ref>

As a result, in Indonesia, the vowel in the English word 'moon' was formerly represented ''oe'', as in Dutch, although the official spelling of this sound was changed to ''u'' in 1947.

Similarly, until 1972, the initial consonant of the English 'chin' was represented in Malaysia as ''ch'', whereas in Indonesia, it continued to follow Dutch and used ''tj''. Hence the word for 'grandchild' used to be written as ''chuchu'' in Malaysia and ''tjoetjoe'' in Indonesia, until a unified spelling system was introduced in 1972 (known in Indonesia as ''Ejaan Yang Disempurnakan'' or the 'Perfected Spelling') which removed most differences between the two varieties: Malaysian ''ch'' and Indonesian ''tj'' became ''c'': hence ''cucu''.

Indonesia abandoned the spelling ''dj'' (for the consonant at the beginning of the word 'Jakarta') to conform to the ''j'' already in use in Malaysia, while the old Indonesian ''j'' for the semivowel at the beginning of the English 'young', was replaced with ''y'' as in Malaysia. Likewise, the [[Voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]] which occurs in many Arabic loanwords, which used to be written 'ch' in Indonesian, became ''kh'' in both languages.

However, ''oe'' was retained in some proper names, such as the name of the first President, [[Sukarno]] (written as ''Soekarno''), and his successor [[Suharto]], (written as ''Soeharto''). The ''ch'' and ''dj'' letter combinations are still encountered in names such as ''Achmad'' and ''Djojo'' (pronounced as ''Akhmad'' and ''Joyo'' respectively), although the post-1972 spelling is now favoured.

Although the representations of speech sounds are now largely identical in the Indonesian and Malaysian standards, a number of minor spelling differences remain, usually for historical reasons. For instance, the word for 'money' is written as ''wang'' in Malaysia, but ''uang'' in Indonesia, the word for 'try' is written as ''cuba'' in Malaysia, but ''coba'' in Indonesia, the word for 'because' is written as ''kerana'' in Malaysia, but ''karena'' in Indonesia, while the word for 'cake' is written as ''kuih'' in Malaysia, but ''kue'' in Indonesia.

One notable difference in [[punctuation]] between the two languages is the use of different [[decimal mark]]s; Indonesian, influenced by Dutch, uses the   [[decimal comma#Countries using Arabic numerals with decimal comma|decimal comma]],<ref>[http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2013/06/14/21044791/Istri.Djoko.Disebut.Beli.Rumah.Rp.7.1.Miliar Istri Djoko Disebut Beli Rumah Rp 7,1 Miliar], ''[[Kompas]]'', 14 June 2013</ref> whereas Malaysian, influenced by English, uses the [[decimal comma#Countries using Arabic numerals with decimal point|decimal point]].<ref>[http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/Ekonomi/20130606/ek_05/58-IBO-berpotensi-jana-RM1.9b 58 IBO berpotensi jana RM1.9b], ''[[Utusan Melayu]]'', 6 June 2013</ref>

==Pronunciation==

Pronunciation also tends to be very different, with East Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia pronouncing words in a form called ''Bahasa Baku'',{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} where the words are pronounced as spelt and enunciation tends to be clipped, staccato and faster than on the Malay Peninsula, which is spoken at a more languorous pace. Many vowels are pronounced (and were formerly spelt) differently in Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, and Sumatra: ''tujuh'' is pronounced (and was spelt) ''tujoh'', ''pilih'' as ''pileh'', etc.,  and many final ''a'''s tend to be pronounced as [[schwa]]s; {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[o]}} are also allophones of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} in closed final syllables in peninsular Malaysian, Singaporean, and Sumatran.

Speakers of Malaysian in [[Peninsular Malaysia]] tend to speak at a more flowing pace, while words that end with the letter "a" often come out as a [[schwa]] (/ə/). Indonesian speakers speak in clipped staccato tones, their "r"s are more markedly trilled (rolled r), and all words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled.

==Vocabulary==

=== Vocabulary differences ===
Indonesian differs from Malaysian in the quantity of words of among others, Javanese and Dutch origin. For example, the word for 'post office' in Malaysia is "pejabat pos" (in Indonesia this means 'post officer'), whereas in Indonesia it is "kantor pos", from the Dutch word for office, ''kantoor''. There are also some [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] influences: in Indonesia, [[Christmas]] is known as "Natal", whereas Malaysia uses "Krismas", derived from English (or in some cases also "Natal", due to Indonesian influence). Pronunciation of some loanwords in Malaysian follows English, while some in Indonesian follows Dutch, for example Malaysian "televisyen" (from English: television) and Indonesian "televisi" (from Dutch: ''televisie''), the "-syen" and "-si" also prevail in some other words. There are also instances where the Malaysian version derives from English pronunciation while the Indonesian version takes its cue from [[Latin]]. The Latin preference of the (older) Indonesian intellectuals in these instances may be ascribed to the influence of their classical-oriented education when [[Gymnasium (school)|''Gymnasium'']] schools were established during the Dutch colonial period : compare Malaysian ''kualiti'', ''kuantiti'', ''majoriti'', ''minoriti'' and ''universiti'' with Indonesian ''kualitas'', ''kuantitas'', ''mayoritas'', ''minoritas'' and ''universitas''.

Some words which are spelt the same in both languages may even carry entirely different meanings in the other language, potentially leading to humorous or embarrassing situations: while ''baja'' means "steel" in Indonesian, in Malaysian it means "fertiliser". Also, whereas the Indonesian word ''butuh'' means "require" or "need", in Malaysia it is a vulgar slang term equivalent to "cunt/cock". Conversely, where the word "banci" seems innocuous enough in Malaysia ("census"), in Indonesia it is a derogatory term for "transvestite".

The relatively large share of Islamic (Arabic or Persian) loan words shared by Malaysian and Indonesian often poses no difficulty in comprehension and usage, although some forms may have developed a (slightly) different meaning or have become obsolete either in Malaysian or in Indonesian, e.g. ''khidmat'', ''wakil'' (see below).

==The influence of English==
One of the most important aspect in differences between Indonesian and Malaysian is the degree of influence from English. Apart from being heavily influenced by the Dutch language, Indonesian language also adopted a significant number of English loan words in its vocabulary, although English didn't play significant role on the Indonesian language and in fact most of these vocabulary are of Dutch origin (note that Dutch and English shared similar Germanic origin). There have been many changes in Indonesian language as a result of its historical development. Words have been freely borrowed from English and only partly assimilated, in many cases, to the Indonesian patterns of structure.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indonesian reference grammar|page=2|author=Roderick Ross Macdonald |isbn=9780878401635 |year= 1976 |publisher=Georgetown University Press|location=Georgetown, USA}}</ref> By the late 1970s, English words pouring into the language, leading one commentator, writing in 1977, to refer to the "trend towards Indo-Saxonisation".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indonesian Language: Its History and Role in Modern Society|page=174 |author=James Sneddon|isbn=978-0868405988|year=2003|publisher=University of New South Wales Press}}</ref> A great many borrowings from English sometimes fulfill no communicative need, expressing concepts adequately covered by existing words. Among the examples are: ''akurat'' instead of ''tepat'' (accurate), ''aliansi'' in the place of ''sekutu'' (alliance), ''eksis'' rather than ''ada'' (exist), ''kandidat'' as well as ''calon'' (candidate), ''konklusi'' instead of ''kesimpulan'' (conclusion) ''kontaminasi'' in the place of ''pencemaran'' (contamination), ''opini'' rather than ''pendapat'' (opinion) and ''opsi'' in the place of ''pilihan'' (option).

Some in Indonesia view this trend of excessive borrowings as "language dynamism", while some Malay{{clarify|date=November 2013}} [[linguist]]s called it mass "language pollution",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dbp.gov.my/klikdbp/klikdbp3mac8.pdf|title=Bahasa Melayu dan Bahasa Indonesia |publisher=Berita Harian |date=2008-03-19 |accessdate=2011-02-09}}</ref> and lack of creativity in creating new terms.

These days a widespread use of English in the Indonesian and Malaysian twittersphere can be observed.  Basolectal and mesolectal English usage couched within Malaysian, and other local language are common.  Twitter has, as an example, become extremely widely used by all sections of society and the next twenty years should see a lot of language-rub from which we could expect to see more Anglicisims move into acrolectical or printed Indonesian and Malaysian.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Convergence of vocabulary==
The rift of evolution between the two languages is based more on political nuance and the history of their formation than on cultural reasons. As a result, views regarding each other's languages differ among Malaysians and Indonesians. In Malaysia, the national language is Malay; in Indonesia, it is Indonesian. Malaysians tend to assert that Malay and Indonesian are merely different varieties of the same language, while Indonesians tend to treat them as separate — albeit related — languages. The result of this attitude is that the Indonesians feel little need to synchronize their language with Malaysia and Brunei, whereas the Malaysians are keener to coordinate the evolution of the language with the Indonesians.<ref>[http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2005/yax-455.htm Who is Malay?, July 2005]</ref> However, both parties have realized that communication benefits from mutually comprehensible and intelligible languages, which motivated efforts to synchronize the languages' development. The effort to synchronize both languages' evolution to increase their mutual intelligibility has been embarked by imposing standard [[rules of language]]. This process is headed by Pusat Bahasa<ref>due to several reorganization in current cabinet, the Indonesian Language Regulator is [http://bahasa.kemdiknas.go.id/lamanbahasa/ Badan Pengembangan dan Pembinaan Bahasa], Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Republik Indonesia</ref> on the Indonesian side and Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka as its Malaysian counterpart.
