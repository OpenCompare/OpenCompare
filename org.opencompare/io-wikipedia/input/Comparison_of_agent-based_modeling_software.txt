In the last few years, the [[agent-based model]]ing (ABM) community has developed several practical agent based modeling toolkits that enable individuals to develop agent-based applications. More and more such toolkits are coming into existence, and each toolkit has a variety of characteristics. Several individuals have made attempts to compare toolkits to each other (see references). Below is a chart intended to capture many of the features that are important to ABM toolkit users.

| Fully programmable with any language that can support activeX components (e.g. C, C++, VB, VBA, Java, and others), but no programming required
| Sim++ can be used with C code or C++ code, but you MUST have a C++ compiler. DOS; Windows (as a DOS application) or OS2 (as a DOS app). The SimPack software is currently being overhauled to use C++ exclusively; however, it will still be possible to use C programs, as before, to access the C++ routines.

| [[SimAgent]] (also [[sim agent]]) [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/packages/simagent.html]
| Research and teaching related to the development of interacting agents in environments of various degrees and kinds of complexity; exploratory research on human-like intelligent agents; systems involving large numbers of highly distributed fairly homogeneous relatively 'small' agents; primarily designed to support design and implementation of very complex agents, each composed of very different interacting components (like a human mind) where the whole thing is embedded in an environment that could be a mixture of physical objects and other agents of many sorts
| Free (open source); MIT/XFREE86 license (for poplog libraries); may later be replaced by GPL
| Pop-11, like Common Lisp, is a powerful extendable multi-purpose programming language supporting multiple paradigms. Within the Poplog environment Pop-11 also supports programs written in Prolog, Common Lisp or Standard ML
| At least prolog version 15; Windows; Mac OS X; Linux; Unix

| Any platform that supports C++;  Technically, the processing environment is supposedly checked for Java 1.4 but Java 1.5 seems to work fine. Simpackj has been tested with 1.5 and exhibits no issues. The SDK is preferred over the JRE, as this could be useful for certain types of Java code that you may be writing. The SDK includes a JRE
