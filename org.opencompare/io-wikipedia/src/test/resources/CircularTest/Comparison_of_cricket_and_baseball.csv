"scoring over the boundary or fence","runs are scored if the ball touches or lands over the boundary; six runs (six) if on the full, four runs (four) if on the bounce or along the ground. If a boundary is scored off a wide or no-ball the extra run is still added so it can also be either five or seven runs.","home run if on the fly (and fair) - one, two, three, or four runs depending on the number of runners on base; automatic double (""ground-rule double"") if on the bounce from fair territory - batter and any runners on base may advance only two bases; thus, only a maximum of two runs may be scored"
"Hits inside the field result in...","as many runs as the batsmen can complete. Normally between zero and three, but there is theoretically no upper limit in unusual circumstances such as misfields, overthrows or lost balls. If the ball strikes a piece of the fielding team's discarded equipment such as hats, helmets etc., an automatic five run penalty is awarded against the fielding side.","runners advancing, with possibility of one or more runners reaching home for a run."
"batsman scoring no runs in an innings","duck (uncommon for a skilled batsman)","struck out (common even for a skilled batter), ""left stranded"" (which occurs when a batter hits the ball and gets on base, but the team gets all out before he is able to score a run - something which doesn't happen in cricket except in the case of a ""diamond duck"" when a batsman is run out without having faced a ball)"

"dismissal procedure","appeal to an umpire – an out cannot be given without an appeal from the fielding side, unless the batsman leaves the field on his own (Law 27).","automatic – most outs are called immediately by umpires; some potential outs require an appeal play to be called but this is rare."
"curving deliveries","leg break, off break, googly, doosra, leg cutter and off cutter change direction after bouncing. Often these will also drift while in the air. Topspinners dip downwards and bounce higher, arm-ball and flipper fly flatter and skid on. The away swing or outswinger curves away from batter in the air, the in swing or inswinger curves toward batter. Seam deliveries will also sometimes turn on the bounce.","breaking balls curve in the air; the curveball/slider/cut fastball away from the pitching-hand side, the sinker, splitter, and forkball unexpectedly dip downwards (as can a curveball; see 12–6 curveball), the rare screwball bends toward pitching-hand side, as will the increasingly common circle change, and the unpredictable knuckleball which relies on atmosphere and wind can literally move in any direction, and even may corkscrew on its way to the plate"

Reverse for a left-handed batsman.","""Left field"" is always to the batter's left and ""right field"" is always to the batter's right (when facing the pitcher), regardless of the side of the plate he hits from. The term ""opposite field"" in baseball is equivalent to ""off side"", as it is the side of the baseball field in front of the batter as he faces the pitcher."
"substitution","injured players can be replaced for fielding and running, not bowling, batting or keeping wicket (Law 2)","players can be replaced in lineup for any reason; once removed they cannot return (except in certain youth leagues such as Little League which allow a ""courtesy runner"" for a pitcher, some recreational leagues and exhibition games, and in special rules such as designated hitter); baseball substitution rule was originally also only in case of injury; unlike cricket, the replacement could also bat"
