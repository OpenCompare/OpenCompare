English contains many [[List of English words of French origin|words of French origin]], such as ''art'', ''competition'', ''force'', ''machine'', ''money'', ''police'', ''publicity'', ''role'', ''routine'', ''table'', and many other anglicized French words. These are pronounced according to [[English language|English]] rules of [[phonology]], rather than [[French language|French]]. Around 45%<ref name="Why Study French">{{cite web|url=http://fren.athabascau.ca/why_study.php|title=Why Study French|publisher=Athabasca University}}</ref> of English vocabulary is of French origin, most coming from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] spoken by the [[upper class]]es in England for several hundred years after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], before the language settled into what became [[Modern English]].

This article, however, covers words and phrases that generally entered the lexicon later, as through literature, the arts, diplomacy, and other cultural exchanges not involving conquests. As such, they have not lost their character as Gallicisms, or words that seem unmistakably foreign and "French" to an English speaker.

The phrases are given as used in English, and may seem correct modern French to English speakers, but may not be recognized as such by French speakers as many of them are now defunct or have drifted in meaning. A general rule is that, if the word or phrase retains French [[diacritic]]s or is usually printed in italics, it has retained its French identity.

Few of these phrases are common knowledge to all English speakers, and for some English speakers most are rarely if ever used in daily conversation, but for other English speakers many of them are a routine part of both their conversational and their written vocabulary.

; [[wikt:vis-à-vis|vis-à-vis]] (also vis-a-vis): lit. "face to face [with]": in comparison with or in relation to; opposed to.

Unlike ''viva'' (Italian and Spanish) or ''vivat'' (Latin), it cannot be used alone; it needs a complement.

;[[wiktionary:vive la différence|vive la différence]] !: lit.

; [[Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?|voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir)?]]:  "Do you want to sleep with me (tonight)?" or more appropriately, "Will you spend the night with me?" In French, ''coucher'' is vulgar in this sense. In English it appears in [[Tennessee Williams]]'s play ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', as well as in the lyrics of a popular song by [[Labelle]], "[[Lady Marmalade]]."

; [[Voyeurism|voyeur]]: lit. "someone who sees"; a [[Peeping Tom]].<ref>"a nation of voyeurs: people who get their gustatory kicks from watching other people cook but don't actually do it themselves", Brenda Maddox, Cooking for kitchen voyeurs, The Times, Wednesday September 11, 1996.</ref>

; zut alors !: "Darn it!" or the British expression "Blimey!" This is a general exclamation (vulgar equivalent is ''merde alors !'' "Damn it!").  Just plain ''zut'' is also in use, often repeated for effect: ''zut, zut et zut !'' There is an album by [[Frank Zappa]], [[pun|punningly]] titled ''[[Zoot Allures]]''.  The phrase is also used on the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' [[Weekend Update]] sketch by recurring character Jean K. Jean, played by [[Kenan Thompson]].

== Not used as such in French ==
Through the evolution of the language, many words and phrases are no longer used in modern French. Also there are expressions that, even though grammatically correct, do not have the same meaning in French as the English words derived from them. Some older word usages still appear in [[Quebec French]].

; [[accoutrement]]: personal military or fighting armaments worn about one's self; has come to mean the accompanying items available to pursue a mission, or just accessories in general. In French, means a funny or ridiculous clothing; often a weird disguise or a getup, though it can be said also for people with bad taste in clothing.

; [[agent provocateur]]: a police spy who infiltrates a group to disrupt or discredit it. In French it has both a broader and more specific meaning. The Académie française, in its dictionary, says that an agent provocateur is a person working for another State or a political party (for example), whose mission is to provoke troubles in order to justify repression.

; [[appliqué]]: an inlaid or attached decorative feature. Lit. "applied," though this meaning doesn't exist as such in French, the dictionary of the Académie française indicates that in the context of the arts, "arts appliqués" is synonym of decorative arts.

; [[après-ski]]: '' after skiing'' socializing after a ski session; in French, this word refers to boots used to walk in snow (e.g. MoonBoots).

; [[wikt:artiste|artiste]]: a skilled performer, a person with artistic pretensions. In French: an artist. Can be used ironically for a person demonstrating little professional skill or passion.

; [[Fencing terms#Blade Work|arrêt à bon temps]]: A counterattack that attempts to take advantage of an uncertain attack in [[fencing]]. Though grammatically correct, this expression is not used in French. The term "arrêt" exists in fencing, with the meaning of a "simple counteroffensive action"; the general meaning is "a stop." A French expression is close, though: "s'arrêter à temps" (to stop in time).

; [[auteur]]: A film director, specifically one who controls most aspects of a film, or other controller of an artistic situation.  The English connotation derives from French film theory.  It was popularized in the journal ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'': auteur theory maintains that directors like Hitchcock exert a level of creative control equivalent to the author of a literary work.  In French, the word means ''author'', but some expressions like "cinéma d'auteur" are also in use.

; [[wikt:au naturel|au naturel]]: nude; in French, literally, in a natural manner or way (''au'' is the contraction of ''à le'', masculine form of ''à la''). It means "in an unaltered way" and can be used either for people or things. For people, it rather refers to a person who does not use make-up or artificial manners (''un entretien au naturel'' = a backstage interview). For things, it means that they have not been altered. Often used in cooking, like ''thon au naturel'': canned tuna without any spices or oil. Also in heraldry, meaning "in natural colours," especially flesh colour, which is not one of the "standard" colours of heraldry.

; [[wikt:à la mode|à la mode]]: fashionable; or with [[ice cream]] (in the US), or with cheese (in some US regions). In French, it mainly means "fashionable" but is occasionally a culinary term usually meaning something cooked with carrots and onions, as in ''boeuf à la mode''.

; [[wikt:bête noire|bête noire]]: a scary or unpopular person, idea, or thing, or the archetypical scary monster in a story; literally "black beast." In French, ''être la bête noire de quelqu'un'' ("to be somebody's black beast") means that you're particularly hated by this person or this person has a strong aversion against you, regardless of whether you're scary or not. The dictionary of the [[Académie française]] admits its use only for people, though other dictionaries admits it for things or ideas too. It also means that one is repeatedly defeated by a person (for instance, "Nadal is the bete noire of Roger Federer"). Colloquial in French.

; [[boutique]]: a clothing store, usually selling designer/one off pieces rather than mass-produced clothes. Can also describe a quirky and/or upmarket hotel. In French, it can describe any shop, clothing or otherwise.

; [[boutonnière]]: In English, a boutonnière is a flower placed in the buttonhole of a suit jacket. In French, a boutonnière is the buttonhole itself.

; c'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre: "it is magnificent, but it is not war" — quotation from [[Pierre Bosquet|Marshal Pierre Bosquet]] commenting on the [[charge of the Light Brigade]]. Unknown quotation in French.

; [[wikt:cause célèbre|cause célèbre]]: An issue arousing widespread controversy or heated public debate, lit. 'famous cause'. It is correct grammatically, but the expression is not used in French.

; chacun à son goût: the correct expressions in French are ''chacun ses goûts / à chacun ses goûts / à chacun son goût'': "to each his/her own taste(s)".

; chanson:  a classical "art song," equiv. to the German ''Lied'' or the Italian ''aria''; or, in Russian, a [[:ru:Шансон|cabaret-style sung narrative]], usually rendered by a guttural male voice with guitar accompaniment. In French, it simply means a song.

; [[château]]: a manor house or a country house of nobility or gentry, with or without fortifications, originally—and still most frequently—in French-speaking regions. The word château is also used for castles in French, so where clarification is needed, the term château fort ("strong castle") is used to describe a castle.

; cinq à sept: extraconjugal affair between five and seven pm. In French, though it can also mean this, it primarily means any relaxing time with friends between the end of work and the beginning of the marital obligations.

; [[claque]]: a group of admirers; in French, la claque is a group of people paid to applaud or disturb a piece at the theatre, though the common meaning of "claque" is "a slap"; ''clique'' is used in this sense (but in a pejorative way).

; [[connoisseur]]: an expert in wines, fine arts, or other matters of culture; a person of refined taste. It is spelled ''conn'''a'''isseur'' in modern French.

; [[corsage]]: A bouquet of flowers worn on a woman's dress or worn around her wrist. In French, it refers to a woman's chest (from shoulder to waist) and, by extension, the part of a woman's garment that covers this area.

; [[coup de main]] (pl. coups de main): a surprise attack. In French, ''[donner] un coup de main'' means  "[to give] a hand" (to give assistance). Even if the English meaning exists as well (as in ''faire le coup de main''), it is old-fashioned.

; [[coup d'état]] (pl. coups d'État): a sudden change in government by force; literally "hit (blow) of state." French uses the capital É, because the use of a capital letter alters the meaning of the word ('''É'''tat: a State, as in a country; '''é'''tat: a state of being). It also cannot be shortened as ''coup'', which means something else altogether in French.

; [[wiktionary:début|début]]: first public performance of an entertainment personality or group. In French, it means "beginning." The English meaning of the word exists only when in the plural form: ''[faire] ses débuts [sur scène]'' (to make one's débuts on the stage).

; [[décolletage]]: a low-cut neckline, cleavage.  In French it means: 1. action of lowering a female garment's neckline; 2. Agric.: cutting leaves from some cultivated roots such as beets, carrots, etc.; 3. Tech. Operation consisting of making screws, bolts, etc. one after another out of a single bar of metal on a parallel lathe.

; [[Demarche|démarche]]: a decisive step. In French, it means a preparing step often used in the plural form, or a distinctive way of walking.

; [[dépanneur]]: a neighbourhood general/convenience store, term used in eastern Canada (often shortened to ''dép'' or ''dep''). This term is commonly used in Canadian French; however, in France, it means a repairman. In France, a convenience store would be a ''supérette'' or ''épicerie [de quartier]''.

; [[émigré]]: one who has emigrated for political reasons. French also use the word ''exilé'' (exiled) or even "exilé politique".

; [[encore (concert)|encore]]: A request to repeat a performance, as in ''Encore!'', lit. 'again'; also used to describe additional songs played at the end of a [[concert|gig]]. Francophones would say «Une autre !» ('Another one!') or «Bis !» to request « un rappel » or « un bis ».

; [[wiktionary:en masse|en masse]]: in a mass or group, all together. In French, ''masse'' refers only to a physical mass, whether for people or objects. It cannot be used for something immaterial, like, for example, the voice: "they all together said 'get out'" would be translated as ''ils ont dit 'dehors' en chœur'' ([like a chorus]). Also, ''en masse'' refers to numerous people or objects (a crowd or a mountain of things).

; [[en suite]]: as a set (not to be confused with ''ensuite'', meaning "then"). Can refer, in particular, to hotel rooms with attached private bathroom, especially in Britain where hotels without private facilities are more common than in North America. In French, ''suite'', when in the context of a hotel, already means several rooms following each other.  ''J'ai loué une suite au Ritz'' would be translated as "I rented a suite at the Ritz."  ''En suite'' is not grammatically incorrect in French, but it is not an expression in itself and it is not used.

; [[épée]]: a fencing weapon descended from the duelling sword. In French, apart from fencing (the sport) the term is more generic: it means sword.

; [[escritoire]]: a writing table. It is spelt ''écritoire'' in modern French.

; [[Exposé (journalism)|exposé]]: a published exposure of a fraud or scandal (past participle of "to expose"); in French refers to a talk or a report on any kind of subject.

; [[femme]]: a stereotypically effeminate gay man or lesbian (slang, pronounced as written). In French, ''femme'' (pronounced 'fam') means "woman."

; [[fin de siècle]]: comparable to (but not exactly the same as) [[turn-of-the-century]] but with a connotation of decadence, usually applied to the period from 1890 through 1910. In French, it means "end of the century," but it isn't a recognized expression as such.

; [[wikt:forte|forte]]: a strength, a strong point, typically of a person, from the French ''fort(e)'' (strong) and/or Italian ''forte'' (strong, esp. "loud" in music) and/or Latin ''forte'' (neuter form of ''fortis'', strong). French uses ''fort(e)'' for both people and objects.
: According to Merriam Webster Dictionary, "In ''forte'' we have a word derived from French that in its "strong point" sense has no entirely satisfactory pronunciation. Usage writers have denigrated \'for-"tA\ and \'for-tE\ because they reflect the influence of the Italian-derived ''forte''. Their recommended pronunciation \'fort\, however, does not exactly reflect French either: the French would write the word ''le fort'' and would rhyme it with English ''for'' [French doesn't pronounce the final "t"]. All are standard, however. In British English \'fo-"tA\ and \'fot\ predominate; \'for-"tA\ and \for-'tA\ are probably the most frequent pronunciations in American English."
: The New Oxford Dictionary of English derives it from fencing. In French, ''le fort d'une épée'' is the third of a blade nearer the hilt, the strongest part of the sword used for parrying.

; la sauce est tout: "The sauce is everything!" or "The secret's in the sauce!" Tagline used in a 1950s American television commercial campaign for an American line of canned food products. Grammatically correct but not used in French, where one might say ''Tout est dans la sauce'' or ''C'est la sauce qui fait (passer) le poisson'' (also fig.).

; [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]]: the sign above a theater that tells you what is playing. From ''marquise'', which means not only a marchioness but also an awning. Theater buildings are generally old and nowadays there is never such a sign above them; there is only the advertisement for the play (''l'affiche'').

; {{visible anchor|nostalgie de la boue}}: "yearning for the mud"; attraction to what is unworthy, crude or degrading.<ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nostalgie%20de%20la%20boue</ref> Though grammatically correct, it is not used in French.

; [[outré]]: out of the ordinary, unusual. In French, it means outraged (for a person) or exaggerated, extravagant, overdone (for a thing, esp. a praise, an actor's style of acting, etc.); in that second meaning, belongs to "literary" style.

; [[passé]]: out of fashion. The correct expression in French is ''passé de mode.''  Passé means past, passed, or (for a colour) faded.

; [[peignoir]]: a woman's dressing gown. In French it is a [[bathrobe]]. A dressing gown is a ''robe de chambre'' (lit. a bedroom dress).

; [[pièce d'occasion]]: "occasional piece"; item written or composed for a special occasion. In French, it means "second-hand hardware." Can be shortened as ''pièce d'occas{{'}}'' or even ''occas{{'}}'' (pronounced /okaz/).

; [[Portmanteau|portemanteau]] (pl. portemanteaux): in English a portmanteau is a large piece of luggage for clothes that opens (like a book or a diptych) into two parts. From this literal sense, [[Lewis Carroll]], in his novel [[Through the Looking Glass]] playfully coined a further [[figurative]] sense for portmanteau meaning a word that fuses two or more words or parts of words to give a combined meaning. In French, lit. a 'coat-carrier', originally a person who carried the royal coat or dress train, now a large suitcase; more often, a clothes hanger. The equivalent of the English/ Lewis-Carroll  ''portemanteau'' is ''un mot-valise'' (lit. a suitcase word).

; [[potpourri]]: medley, mixture; French write it ''pot-pourri'', literally 'rotten pot': primarily a pot in which different kinds of flowers or spices are put to dry for years for the scent.

; [[wikt:précis|précis]]: a concise summary. In French, when talking about a school course, it means an abridged book about the matter. Literally, ''précis'' means precise, accurate.

; [[première]]: refers to the first performance of a play, a film, etc. In French, it means "the first", and is used only for a live performance.

; [[wikt:raisonneur|raisonneur]]: a type of author intrusion in which a writer inserts a character to argue the author's viewpoint; alter ego, sometimes called 'author avatar'. In French, a ''raisonneur'' is a character in a play who stands for morality and reason, i.e., not necessarily the author's point of view. The first meaning of this word though is a man (fem. ''raisonneuse'') who overdoes reasonings, who tires by objecting with numerous arguments to every order.

; [[wikt:recherché|recherché]]: lit. searched; obscure; pretentious. In French, means 'sophisticated' or 'delicate', or simply 'studied', without the negative connotations of the English.

; [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]]: lit. "present yourself" or "proceed to"; a meeting, appointment, or date in French, but in English has taken on other overtones. Always hyphenated in French: ''rendez-vous''. Its only accepted abbreviation in French is RDV.

; [[reprise]]: repetition of previous music in a suite, programme, etc. In French, it may mean an alternate version of a piece of music, or a [[cover version]]. To express the repetition of a previous musical theme, French would exclusively use the Italian term [[Coda (music)|coda]].

; [[résumé]]: in [[North American English]], a document listing one's qualifications for employment. In French, it means summary; French speakers would use instead ''curriculum vitæ'', or its abbreviation, C.V. (like most other English speakers)

; [[wikt:risqué|risqué]] '''(also risque)''' : sexually suggestive;<ref>"Teacher Alan Faulkner warned: 'Some of the skirts were getting very risque and [...] the girls would face disciplinary action'," Daily Mail, Saturday September 21, 1996.</ref> in French, the meaning of ''risqué'' is "risky," with no sexual connotation. Francophones use instead ''osé'' (lit. "daring") or sometimes ''dévergondé'' (very formal language). ''Osé'', unlike ''dévergondé'', cannot be used for people themselves, only for things (such as pictures) or attitudes.

; [[séance]] : a gathering, usually using a 'medium', attempting to communicate with the dead. In French, the word means 'sitting' and usually refers to any kind of meeting or session.

; [[table d'hôte]] (pl. tables d'hôte): in English, when used it usually refers to type of meal: a full-course meal offered at a fixed price. However, in French, it refers to a type of lodging: the closest English equivalent would be "a bed & breakfast" or "B&B."  The origin of the meaning (for French speakers) is that at a table d'hôte (literally "table of the house" or "table of the host"), unlike at a full-service purpose-built hotel, all patrons eat together at the host's table, whatever the family have prepared for themselves (typically traditional regional dishes). Indeed, in France today a lodging labelled "table d'hôte" might perhaps not even offer food; the appellation meaning what an English-speaker would think of as a "bed & breakfast -style" family-home lodging (as opposed to a purpose-built hotel).

; [[tableau vivant]] (pl. tableaux vivants, often shortened as ''tableau''): in drama, a scene where actors remain motionless as if in a picture. ''Tableau'' means painting, ''tableau vivant'', living painting. In French, it is an expression used in body painting.

; touché: acknowledgment of an effective counterpoint. In French, used for "emotionally touched".

; [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]: a brief description; a short scene. In French, it is a small picture, and now in some European countries also means 'permit for driving on motorways.'

; [[aide-de-camp]]: "camp assistant"; in the army, a military assistant to a senior military officer (heads of State are considered military officers because of their status as head of the army). In Canada, it may also refer to the honorary position a person holds as a personal assistant to a high civil servant. It exists in French too but is written ''aide de camp'' (without any hyphens).

; [[chef]]: in English, a person who cooks professionally for other people. In French, a professional cook is a ''restaurateur''. A chef (literally "head"), means a master cook or chief cook. Also, '''sous-chef''', the second-in-command, directly under the head chef. Additionally, in a work context, a chef is one's boss.

; [[cinquefoil]]: five-petal, five-leaf flower of the genus Potentilla, family Rosaceae; also a circular 5-lobed ornamental design. Spelled ''quintefeuille'' in French.

; [[wiktionary:cri du coeur|cri de cœur]]: "cry from the heart": an impassioned outcry, as of entreaty or protest. In French, the exact expression is ''cri '''du''' cœur''.

; [[demi-monde]]: a class of women of ill repute; a fringe group or subculture. Fell out of use in the French language in the 19th century. Frenchmen still use ''une demi-mondaine'' to qualify a woman that lives (exclusively or partially) off the commerce of her charms but in a high-life style.

; [[double entendre]]: a figure of speech wherein a word or phrases can be taken to have two distinct coherent meanings, most often in a fashion that is suggestive and/or ironic. "Entendre" is an infinitive verb ("to hear"), not a noun; a correct rendering would be "à double entente", an adjectival phrase meaning "of a double understanding or double interpretation" (literally, "with a double hearing"). The modern French phrase is "à double sens".<!-- According to etymonline "entendre" is archaic, not incorrect. -->

; [[entrée]]: lit. "entrance"; in French, the first dish that starts a meal, i.e. the entrance to the meal. Synonym of "hors d'œuvre". The main dish or "plat de résistance" comes after the entrée. In American English, the meaning has migrated to "main dish".  In other varieties of English it maintains its French meaning.

; [[Homage (arts)|homage]]: term used for films that are influenced by other films, in particular by the works of a notable director. French word is written ''ho'''mm'''age'', and is used for all shows of admiration, respect, or in a close sense for dedication of an artwork to another.

; [[hors d'oeuvre]]: term used for the snacks served with drinks before a meal. Literally "outside of the work". The French use ''apéritif'' to refer to the time before a meal and the drinks consumed during that time, yet "hors d'œuvre" is a synonym of "entrée" in French and means the first dish that starts a meal.

; [[wikt:in lieu|in lieu]] (of): "in place (of)": a hybrid phrase, partially translated from the existing French phrase ''au lieu''.

; [[legerdemain|léger de main]] (legerdemain): "light of hand": [[sleight of hand]], usually in the context of deception or the art of stage magic tricks. Meaningless in French, and has no equivalent. <!-- redirects to sleight of hand, which has it as léger de main, not sure if I should pipe or not -->

; [[maître d']]: translates as ''master o'''. Francophones would say ''maître d'hôtel'' (literally "master of the house" or "master of the establishment") instead (French never uses "d{{single double}} alone). In French as in English, "maître d'" means the "head waiter", the manager of the service side.

; [[negligée]]: A robe or a dressing gown, usually of sheer or soft fabric for women. French uses ''négligé'' (masculine form) or ''nuisette''. In French, the word ''négligée'' qualifies a woman who neglects her appearance.

; [[pièce de résistance]] ('''piece de resistance'''): the best; the main dish in a meal, or the main item in a series, literally "a piece that resists."<ref>"The living room, with its leather sofa from Harrods, payphone and glass coffee table, is the pièce de résistance," My friend the high-flying dole cheat, The Daily Telegraph, Wednesday, August 14, 1996.</ref> Francophones use ''plat de résistance'' (main dish).

; [[Single (football)|rouge]]: lit. "red"; 1) red makeup, also called blusher; 2) in [[Canadian football]], awarded when the ball is kicked into the end zone by any legal means, other than a successful field goal, and the receiving team does not return, or kick, the ball out of its end zone.

; [[succès de scandale]]: "Success through scandal"; Francophones might use ''succès par médisance''.

; [[voir dire]]: a trial within a trial, or (in America) jury selection ([[Law French]]). Literally "to speak the truth."<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/voir%20dire?r=1 voir dire] The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition (2006)</ref> ([[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''voir'' [''truth''] is etymologically unrelated to the modern French ''voir'' [''to see''].)<ref>[http://www.anglo-norman.net/D/voir voir] The Anglo-Norman Dictionary</ref>  In modern American court procedure, the examination of prospective jurors for their qualification to serve, including inherent biases, views and predelictions; during this examination, each prospective juror must "speak the truth" so that counsel and the court may decide whether they should remain on the jury or be excused.  In England and Wales, the expression is used to refer to a "trial within a trial," during which a judge hears evidence in the absence of the jury, typically to decide whether a certain piece of evidence should be allowed to be presented to the jury or not.  For example, a judge might hold a "voir dire" to determine whether a confession has been extracted from a defendant by an unfair inducement in order to decide whether the jury should hear evidence of the confession or not.

== French phrases in international air-sea rescue ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Greek War of Independence]] -->

International authorities have adopted a number of words and phrases from French for use by speakers of all languages in voice communications during [[air-sea rescue]]s. Note that the "phonetic" versions of spelling are presented as shown and not the [[Help:IPA|IPA]].

; [[Securité|SECURITAY]]: (''sécurité'', "safety") the following is a safety message or warning, the lowest level of danger.
; [[Pan-pan|PAN PAN]]: (''panne'', "breakdown") the following is a message concerning a danger to a person or ship, the next level of danger.
; [[Mayday (distress signal)|MAYDAY]]: (''[venez] m'aider'', come to help me"; ''aidez-moi'' means "help me") the following is a message of extreme urgency, the highest level of danger. ''(MAYDAY is used on voice channels for the same uses as SOS on [[Morse code|Morse]] channels.)''
; SEELONCE: (''silence'', "silence") keep this channel clear for air-sea rescue communications.
; SEELONCE FEE NEE: (''silence fini'', "silence is over") this channel is now available again.
; PRU DONCE: (''prudence'', "prudence") silence partially lifted, channel may be used again for urgent non-distress communication.
; MAY DEE CAL: (''médical'', "medical") medical assistance needed.

It is a serious breach in most countries, and in international zones, to use any of these phrases without justification.

''See [[Mayday (distress signal)]] for a more detailed explanation.''
