"Data Passing","ADO objects communicate in binary mode.","ADO.NET uses XML for passing the data."
"Control of data access behaviors","Includes implicit behaviors that may not always be required in an application and that may therefore limit performance.","Provides well-defined, factored components with predictable behavior, performance, and semantics."
"Design-time support","Derives information about data implicitly at run time, based on metadata that is often expensive to obtain.","Leverages known metadata at design time in order to provide better run-time performance and more consistent run-time behavior."
