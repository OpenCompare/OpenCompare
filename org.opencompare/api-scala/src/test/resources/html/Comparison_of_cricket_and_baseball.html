The away swing or outswinger curves away from batter in the air, the in swing or inswinger curves toward batter. Seam deliveries will also sometimes turn on the bounce.

            breaking balls curve in the air; the curveball/slider/cut fastball away from the pitching-hand side, the sinker, splitter, and forkball unexpectedly dip downwards (as can a curveball; see 12–6 curveball), the rare screwball bends toward pitching-hand side, as will the increasingly common circle change, and the unpredictable knuckleball which relies on atmosphere and wind can literally move in any direction, and even may corkscrew on its way to the plate

          </td>
          <td>
            &quot;Left field&quot; is always to the batter's left and &quot;right field&quot; is always to the batter's right (when facing the pitcher), regardless of the side of the plate he hits from. The term &quot;opposite field&quot; in baseball is equivalent to &quot;off side&quot;, as it is the side of the baseball field in front of the batter as he faces the pitcher.
