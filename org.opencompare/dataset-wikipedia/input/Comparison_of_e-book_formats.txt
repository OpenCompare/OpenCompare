The following is a '''comparison of e-book formats''' used to create and publish [[e-book]]s.

The EPUB format is the most widely supported vendor-independent XML-based (as opposed to PDF) e-book format; that is, it is supported by the largest number of e-Readers, including Amazon Kindle  (see table below for details).

|}
The digital book format originally used by [[Sony Corporation]].  It is a proprietary format, but some reader software for general-purpose computers, particularly under [[GNU Project|GNU]]/Linux (for example, [[Calibre (software)|Calibre]]’s internal viewer), have the capability to read it.  The LRX file extension represents a [[Digital rights management|DRM]] encrypted eBook. More recently, Sony has converted its books from BBeB to EPUB and is now issuing new titles in EPUB.

|}
CHM format is a proprietary format based on HTML. Multiple pages and embedded graphics are distributed along with proprietary [[metadata]] as a single compressed file.  In contrast, in HTML, a site consists of multiple HTML files and associated image files in standardized formats.

===DAISY – ANSI/NISO Z39.86  ===

The Digital Accessible Information SYstem (DAISY) is an [[XML]]-based open standard maintained by the DAISY Consortium for people with [[print disabilities]].  DAISY has wide international support with features for multimedia, navigation and synchronization. A subset of the DAISY format has been adopted by law in the United States as the National Instructional Material Accessibility Standard (NIMAS), and K-12 textbooks and instructional materials are now required to be provided to students with disabilities.

DAISY is already aligned with the EPUB open standard, and is expected to fully converge with its forthcoming EPUB3 revision.

===DjVu ===

|-
| style="background:#ddd; width:100px;"| ''Format'':
| DjVu
|-
| style="background:#ddd;"| ''Published as'':
| .[[DjVu|djvu]]
|}
DjVu is a format specialized for storing scanned documents. It includes advanced compressors optimized for low-color images, such as text documents. Individual files may contain one or more pages. DjVu files cannot be re-flowed.

The contained page images are divided in separate layers (such as multi-color, low-resolution, background layer using lossy compression, and few-colors, high-resolution, tightly compressed foreground layer), each compressed in the best available method. The format is designed to decompress very quickly, even faster than vector-based formats.

The advantage of DjVu is that it is possible to take a high-resolution scan (300–400 DPI), good enough for both on-[[screen reading]] and printing, and store it very efficiently. Several dozens of 300 DPI black-and-white scans can be stored in less than a megabyte.

|}
[[File:EPUB logo.svg|thumb|right|150px|The EPUB logo.]]
The .epub or [[OEBPS]] format is an open standard for e-books created by the [[International Digital Publishing Forum]] (IDPF). It combines three IDPF open standards:
* Open Publication Structure (OPS) 2.0, which describes the content markup (either XHTML or Daisy [[DTBook]])
* Open Packaging Format (OPF) 2.0, which describes the structure of an .epub in XML
* OEBPS Container Format (OCF) 1.0, which bundles files together (as a renamed ZIP file)

The EPUB format has gained some popularity as a vendor-independent XML-based e-book format. The format can be read by the [[Kobo eReader]], [[BlackBerry]] devices, Apple's [[iBooks]] app running on [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] devices, [[Google Play|Google Books]] app running on Android and iOS devices, Barnes & Noble [[Nook]], Amazon [[Kindle]] , [[Sony Reader]], [[BeBook]], [[Cybook Gen3|Bookeen Cybook Gen3 (with firmware v2 and up)]], COOL-ER, [[Adobe Digital Editions]], [[Lexcycle Stanza]], BookGlutton, AZARDI, [[FBReader]], [[Aldiko]], [[CoolReader]], [[Mantano Reader]], [[Moon+ Reader]], the [[Mozilla Firefox]] [[Add-on (Mozilla)|add-on]] [[EPUBReader]], [[Okular]] and other reading apps.

EPUB is now supported by Amazon Kindle. KDP converts unzipped EPUB files. Amazon recommends validating the file using Kindle Gen or Kindle Previewer prior to submission.There are a number of programs that output EPUB files, including [[Calibre (software)|calibre]].

[[Adobe Digital Editions]] uses .epub format for its e-books, with [[Digital rights management|DRM]] protection provided through their proprietary ADEPT mechanism. The recently developed ADEPT framework and scripts have been reverse-engineered to circumvent this [[Digital rights management|DRM]] system.

===eReader ===

|}

eReader is a [[freeware]] program for viewing Palm Digital Media electronic books which use the pdb format used by many Palm applications. Versions are available for [[iPhone]], [[Palm OS]] (not webOS), [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Symbian]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Windows Mobile]] Pocket PC/Smartphone, desktop [[Windows]], and [[Macintosh]]. The reader shows text one page at a time, as paper books do. eReader supports embedded hyperlinks and images. Additionally, the [[Lexcycle Stanza|Stanza]] application for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] can read both [[encryption|encrypted]] and unencrypted eReader files.

The program supports features like bookmarks and footnotes, enabling the user to mark any page with a bookmark, and any part of the text with a footnote-like commentary. Footnotes can later be exported as a Memo document.

On July 20, 2009, [[Barnes & Noble]] made an announcement implying that eReader would be the company's preferred format to deliver e-books. Exactly three months later, in a press release by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], it was revealed Barnes & Noble would be joining forces with the software company to standardize the open EPUB and PDF eBook formats. Barnes & Noble e-books are now sold mostly in EPUB format.

===FictionBook (Fb2) ===

{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#ddd; width:100px;"| ''Format'':
| FictionBook
|-
| style="background:#ddd;"| ''Published as'':

|}

[[FictionBook]] is a popular [[XML]]-based e-book format, supported by free readers such as [[FBReader]], [[Okular]], [[CoolReader]], [[Bebook]] and [[STDU Viewer]].

The FictionBook format does not specify the appearance of a document; instead, it describes its structure and semantics. All the ebook metadata, such as the author name, title, and publisher, is also present in the ebook file. Hence the format is convenient for automatic processing, indexing, and ebook collection management. This also is convenient to store books in it for later automatic conversion into other formats.

===Founder Electronics ===

|-
| style="background:#ddd; width:100px;"| ''Format'':
| Apabi Reader
|-
| style="background:#ddd;"| ''Published as'':
| .[[XEB|xeb]]; .ceb
|}
[[APABI]] is a format devised by [[Founder Electronics]]. It is a popular format for Chinese e-books. It can be read using the [[Apabi Reader]] software, and produced using [[Apabi Publisher]]. Both .xeb and .ceb files are encoded binary files. The [[iLiad (E-book Reader)|Iliad]] e-book device includes an Apabi 'viewer'.

===Hypertext Markup Language ===
{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#ddd; width:100px;"| ''Format'':
| Hypertext
|-
| style="background:#ddd;"| ''Published as'':
| .htm; .html
|}
[[HTML]] is the [[markup language]] used for most [[World Wide Web|web]] pages. E-books using HTML can be read using a [[Web browser]]. The specifications for the format are  available without charge from the [[W3C]].

HTML adds specially marked meta-elements to otherwise plain text encoded using [[character set]]s like [[ASCII]] or [[UTF-8]]. As such, suitably formatted files can be, and sometimes are, generated ''by hand'' using a ''[[text editor|plain text editor]]'' or ''[[Source code editor|programmer's editor]]''. Many ''HTML generator'' applications exist to ease this process and often require less intricate knowledge of the format details involved.

HTML on its own is not a particularly efficient format to store information in, requiring more storage space for a given work than many other formats. However, several e-Book formats including the Amazon Kindle, Open eBook, Compiled HTML,  Mobipocket and EPUB store each book chapter in HTML format, then use [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] compression to compress the HTML data, images, metadata and style sheets into a single, significantly smaller, file.

HTML files encompass a wide range of standards and displaying HTML files correctly can be complicated. Additionally many of the features supported, such as forms, are not relevant to e-books.

===iBook (Apple) ===
{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#ddd; width:100px;"| ''Format'':
| iBook
|-
| style="background:#ddd;"| ''Published as'':
| .ibooks
|}
The .ibooks format is created with the free [[iBooks Author]] ebook layout software from [[Apple Inc.]]. This proprietary format is based on the [[EPUB]] standard, with some differences in the CSS tags used in an ibooks format file, thus making it incompatible with the EPUB open standard. The End-User Licensing Agreement (EULA) that comes with iBooks Author states that "If you want to charge a fee for a work that includes files in the .ibooks format generated using iBooks Author, you may only sell or distribute such work through Apple". The "through Apple" will typically be in the Apple [[iBooks]] store. The EULA further states that "This restriction does not apply to the content of such works when distributed in a form that does not include files in the .ibooks format." Therefore, Apple has not included distribution restrictions in the iBooks Author EULA for ibooks format ebooks created in iBooks Author that are made available for free, and it does not prevent authors from re-purposing the content in other ebook formats to be sold outside the iBookstore. This software currently supports import and export functionally for three formats. ibook, Plain text and PDF. It does not support importing or exporting in EPUB format.

IEC 62448 is an international standard created by [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), Technical Committee 100, Technical Area 10 (Multimedia e-publishing and e-book).

The current version of IEC 62448 is an umbrella standard that contains as appendices two concrete formats, XMDF of Sharp and BBeB of Sony. However, BBeB has been discontinued by Sony and the version of XMDF that is in the specification is out of date. The IEC TA10 group is discussing the next steps, and has invited the IDPF organization which has standardized [[EPUB]] to be a liaison. It is possible that the current version of EPUB and/or the forthcoming EPUB3 revision may be added to IEC 62448.  Meanwhile a number of Japanese companies have proposed that IEC standardize a proposed new Japanese-centric file format that is expected to unify DotBook of Voyager Japan and XMDF of Sharp.  This new format has not been publicly disclosed as of November 2010 but it is supposed to cover basic representations for the Japanese language.  Technically speaking, this revision is supposed to provide a Japanese minimum set, a Japanese extension set, and a stylesheet language. These issues were discussed in the TC100 meeting held  in October 2010 but no decisions were taken besides offering the liaison status to IDPF.

===KF8 (Amazon Kindle) ===

With the release of the [[Kindle Fire]] reader in late 2011, [[Amazon.com]] also released [[Kindle Format 8]], their newest file format, also known as .AZW3. The .azw3 file format supports a subset of [[HTML5]] and [[CSS3]] features, with some additional nonstandard features; the new data is stored within a container which can also be used to store a Mobi content document, allowing limited backwards compatibility.

Older [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] e-readers use the proprietary format, AZW. It is based on the [[Mobipocket]] standard, with a slightly different serial number scheme (it uses an [[asterisk]] instead of a [[dollar sign]]) and its own [[Digital rights management|DRM]] formatting. Because the ebooks bought on the Kindle are delivered over its wireless system called Whispernet, the user does not see the AZW files during the download process. The Kindle format is available on a variety of platforms, such as through the Kindle app for the various mobile device platforms.

===Microsoft LIT ===
{| style="text-align:left;"
|-
| style="background:#ddd; width:100px;"| ''Format'':
| Microsoft Reader
|-
| style="background:#ddd;"| ''Published as'':
| .[[LIT (file format)|lit]]
|}
DRM-protected LIT files are only readable in the proprietary [[Microsoft Reader]] program, as the .LIT format, otherwise similar to Microsoft's [[Microsoft Compiled HTML Help|CHM]] format, includes [[Digital Rights Management]] features. Other third party readers, such as [[Lexcycle Stanza]], can read unprotected LIT files.

The Microsoft Reader uses patented [[ClearType]] display technology. In Reader navigation works with a keyboard, mouse, stylus, or through electronic bookmarks. The Catalog Library records reader books in a personalized "home page", and books are displayed with ClearType to improve readability.  A user can add annotations and notes to any page, create large-print e-books with a single command, or create free-form drawings on the reader pages.  A built-in dictionary allows the user to look up words.

In August 2011, Microsoft announced they were discontinuing both Microsoft Reader and the use of the .lit format for ebooks at the end of August 2012, and ending sales of the format on November 8, 2011.

===Mobipocket ===

| style="background:#ddd; width:100px;"| ''Format'':
| Mobipocket
|-
| style="background:#ddd;"| ''Published as'':
| [[PRC (Palm OS)|.prc]]; .mobi
|}
The [[Mobipocket]] e-book format is based on the [[Open eBook]] standard using [[XHTML]] and can include [[JavaScript]] and frames. It also supports native [[SQL]] queries to be used with embedded databases. There is a corresponding e-book reader.

The [[Mobipocket]] Reader has a home page library. Readers can add blank pages in any part of a book and add free-hand drawings. Annotations – highlights, bookmarks, corrections, notes, and drawings – can be applied, organized, and recalled from a single location. Images are converted to GIF format and have a maximum size of 64K, sufficient for mobile phones with small screens, but rather restrictive for newer gadgets. [[Mobipocket]] Reader has electronic bookmarks,  and a built-in dictionary.

The reader has a full screen mode for reading and support for many [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[Personal digital assistant|Communicators]], and [[Smartphone]]s. [[Mobipocket]] products support most Windows, Symbian, BlackBerry and Palm operating systems, but not the Android platform. Using WINE, the reader works under Linux or Mac OS X. Third-party applications like [[Okular]] and [[FBReader]] can also be used under Linux or Mac OS X, but they work only with unencrypted files.

The Amazon Kindle's AZW format is basically just the Mobipocket format with a slightly different serial number scheme (it uses an asterisk instead of a [[dollar sign]]), and .prc publications can be read directly on the Kindle.  The Kindle AZW format also lacks some Mobipocket features such as JavaScript.

[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] has developed an .epub to .mobi converter called KindleGen, and it supports IDPF 1.0 and IDPF 2.0 EPUB format.

A [[multimedia ebook]] is [[media (communication)|media]] and [[book]] [[content (media and publishing)|content]] that utilizes a combination of different book [[content format]]s. The term can be used as a noun (a medium with multiple content formats) or as an adjective describing a medium as having multiple content formats.

The "multimedia ebook" term is used in contrast to media which only utilize traditional forms of printed or text books. Multimedia ebooks include a combination of [[Written language|text]], [[Audio file format|audio]], [[image]]s, [[video]], or [[interactive]] content formats.  Much like how a traditional book can contain images to help the text tell a story, a multimedia ebook can contain other elements not formerly possible to help tell the story.

With the advent of more widespread tablet-like computers, such as the [[smartphone]], some publishing houses are planning to make multimedia ebooks, such as Penguin.

===Newton eBook ===

| style="background:#ddd; width:100px;"| ''Format'':

|-
| style="background:#ddd;"| ''Published as'':

|}
Commonly known as an [[Apple Newton]] book; a single Newton package file can contain multiple books (for example, the three books of a trilogy might be packaged together). All systems running the Newton operating system (the most common include the Newton MessagePads, eMates, Siemens Secretary Stations, Motorola Marcos, Digital Ocean Seahorses and Tarpons) have built-in support for viewing Newton books. The Newton package format was released to the public by Newton, Inc. prior to that company's absorption into Apple Computer. The format is thus arguably open and various people have written readers for it (writing a Newton book converter has even been assigned as a university-level class project).

Newton books have no support for DRM or encryption. They do support internal links, potentially multiple tables of contents and indexes, embedded gray scale images, and even some scripting capability (for example, it's possible to make a book in which the reader can influence the outcome). Newton books utilize [[Unicode]] and are thus available in numerous languages. An individual [[Newton book]] may actually contain multiple views representing the same content in different ways (such as for different screen resolutions).

Invented by [[Adobe Systems]], and first released in 1993, [[PDF]] became ISO 32000 in 2008. The format was developed to provide a platform-independent means of exchanging fixed-layout documents. Derived from [[PostScript]], but without language features like loops, PDF adds support for features such as compression, passwords, semantic structures and DRM. Because PDF documents can easily be viewed and printed by users on a variety of computer [[Platform (computing)|platforms]], they are very common on the [[World Wide Web]] and in document management systems worldwide. The current PDF specification, ISO 32000-1:2008, is available from ISO's website, and under special arrangement, without charge from Adobe.

Because the format is designed to reproduce fixed-layout pages, re-flowing text to fit mobile device and e-book reader screens has traditionally been problematic. This limitation was addressed in 2001 with the release of PDF Reference 1.5 and "Tagged PDF", but 3rd party support for this feature was limited until the release of [[PDF/UA]] in 2012.

Many products support creating and reading PDF files, such as Adobe Acrobat, [[PDFCreator]] and [[OpenOffice.org]], and several programming libraries such as [[iText]] and [[Formatting Objects Processor|FOP]]. Third party viewers such as [[xpdf]] and [[Nitro PDF]] are also available. Mac OS X has built-in PDF support, both for creation as part of the printing system and for display using the built-in Preview application.

PDF files are supported by almost all modern e-book readers, tablets and smartphones. However, PDF reflow based on Tagged PDF, as opposed to re-flow based on the actual sequence of objects in the content-stream, is not yet commonly supported on mobile devices. Such Re-flow options as may exist are usually found under "view" options, and may be called "word-wrap".

The first e-books in history were in [[text file|plain text]] (.txt) format, supplied for free by the [[Project Gutenberg]] community, but the format itself existed before the e-book era. The plain text format doesn't support digital rights management (DRM) or formatting options (such as different fonts, graphics or colors), but it has excellent portability as it is the simplest e-book encoding possible as a plain text file contains only [[ASCII]] or [[Unicode]] text (text files with [[Unicode]] or [[UTF-8]] encoding are also popular for languages other than English). Almost all operating systems can read ASCII text files (e.g. Unix, Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, DOS and other systems) and newer operating systems support Unicode text files as well. The only potential for portability problems of ASCII text files is that operating systems differ in their preferred line ending convention and their interpretation of values outside the ASCII range (their character encoding). Conversion of files from one to another line-ending convention is easy with free software. DOS and Windows uses CRLF, Unix and Apple's OS X use LF, Mac OS up to and including OS 9 uses CR. By convention, lines are often broken to fit into 80 characters, a legacy of older terminals and consoles. Alternately, each paragraph may be a single line.

The size in bytes of a text file is simply the number of characters, including spaces, and with a new line counting for 1 or 2. For example, the [[Bible]], which is approximately 800,000 words, is about 4 MB.

====Aozora Bunko====
[[Aozora Bunko]], a Japanese website that offers public domain ebooks for free download, issues files in a modified plain text format. The format has special encoding for [[furigana]] and inline comments, meant to provide guidelines for publishers. Some ebook readers exist which can render this format.

The [[TomeRaider]] e-book format is a proprietary format. There are versions of [[TomeRaider]] for Windows, Windows Mobile (aka Pocket PC), Palm, Symbian and iPhone. Several Wikipedias are available as [[Wikipedia:TomeRaider database|TomeRaider files]] with all articles unabridged, some even with nearly all images. Capabilities of the TomeRaider3 e-book reader vary considerably per platform: the Windows and Windows Mobile editions support full [[HTML]] and [[CSS]]. The Palm edition supports limited HTML (e.g., no tables, no fonts), and CSS support is missing. For Symbian there is only the older TomeRaider2  format, which does not render images or offer category search facilities. Despite these differences any TomeRaider e-book can be browsed on all supported platforms.  The Tomeraider website claims to have over 4000 e-books available, including free versions of the [[Internet Movie Database]] and [[Wikipedia]].

'''Open XML Paper Specification''' (also referred to as '''OpenXPS''') is an open [[specification]] for a [[page description language]] and a fixed-document format. [[Microsoft]] developed it as the XML Paper Specification (XPS). In June 2009, [[Ecma International]] adopted it as international standard '''ECMA-388'''.

The format is intentionally restricted to sequences of:
Glyphs (a fixed run of text),
Paths (a geometry that can be filled, or stroked, by a brush), and
Brushes (a description of a shaped brush used to in rendering paths).

This reduces the possibility of inadvertent introduction of malicious content and simplifies the implementation of compatible renderers.
